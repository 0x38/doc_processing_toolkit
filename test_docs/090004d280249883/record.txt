Subject: Arctic oil and gas DEIS

 

Kate and Tim,

 

Several months ago we briefly discussed the Arctic Oil and Gas DEIS, and as you may know a few weeks ago PR
held a meeting with industry to address concerns with this document.  The meeting did not ease concerns, however,
and the attachment explains some key ongoing issues with the DEIS.  I wanted to keep you in the loop on the latest
and see if you have any insight or advice on this matter.  I’d be happy to discuss at your convenience.

 

Thanks very much – Kris
