Foreword

Arctic communities and settlements are largely based on the use of natural resources. Traditionally these 
activities included hunting, fishing and reindeer herding. Commercial fisheries are now of major signifi-
cance in several Arctic regions. The importance of the non-renewable resources is growing. Both onshore 
and offshore petroleum developments are expanding to new areas of the Arctic. Also external pressures 
from climate change and long-range pollution are of growing significance in the Arctic.

New economic activities may provide an important basis for welfare and economic growth. It is vital that 
all resource use is planned and carried out in a sustainable manner to facilitate the coexistence of activities 
in different sectors. Economic activities must be carried out in accordance with environmental and safety 
standards, to the benefit of Arctic communities. Minimizing negative impacts of commercial activities 
on the ecosystems and living resources of the Arctic is a particularly important task, and that has to be 
considered in light of climate change and pollution issues. 

On the basis of the mandate given at the Salekhard ministerial meeting in 2006, the Norwegian chairman-
ship of the Arctic Council initiated a project on ecosystem-based oceans management. This project was 
undertaken as an approved project of the Arctic Council Sustainable Development Working Group and 
the Protection of the Arctic Marine Environment Working Group. The project report was prepared by a 
project team and does not necessarily reflect the policy or positions of any Arctic State, Permanent 
Participant or Observer of the Arctic Council.

Introduction

Background and rationale
The aggregate effects of multiple uses of the oceans – fishing, 
transportation, petroleum development, waste disposal, etc. – call for 
an ecosystem-based approach to oceans management. The need for 
oceans management based on an ecosystem approach is now widely 
recognized by the international community, as reflected in calls for the 
application of the ecosystem approach by 2010 in the 2002 Johannes-
burg Plan of Implementation from WSSD1 as well as in recommenda-
tions from the UN General Assembly.2 In the Arctic context, the 2004 
Arctic Marine Strategic Plan3 points to challenges and opportunities in 
this regard, and the working map of the 17 Arctic LMEs represents a 
basis for further work.

The 2004 Arctic Marine Strategic Plan defines ecosystem-based man-
agement as an approach that “requires that development activities be 
coordinated in a way that minimizes their impact on the environment 
and integrates thinking across environmental, socio-economic, politi-
cal and sectoral realms.”4

The employment of an ecosystem-based approach to oceans man-
agement is critical to the protection and sustainable use of marine 
ecosystems.  However, the form and content of the ecosystem-based 
approach to oceans management is context dependent and vary from 
case to case. An important distinction is between the ecosystem-based 
approach to the management as applied to oceans in general on the one 
hand, and its use within one sector, as e.g. fisheries, on the other. 

The application of the ecosystem approach to oceans management of 
Arctic waters raises a number of issues with commonalities across the 
Arctic region: ice-covered waters, transboundary cooperation, fisheries 
management, exploitation of petroleum under severe climatic condi-
tions, long-range transport of pollutants, indigenous communities, 
socio-economic growth and sustainability issues, and the impacts of 
climate change.

Objectives
Oceans management is carried out by governments, independently 
and in cooperation with other states. States and their practices in 
ecosystem-based oceans management ais therefore the basis for an 
analysis of the factors that contribute to sustainable use and conserva-
tion of Arctic marine ecosystems.

The objective of the project is to present the concepts and practices the 
Arctic countries have developed for the application of an ecosystem-
based approach to oceans management. By way of reviewing how 
countries actually put to use such concepts and practices, lessons can 
be drawn on how to effectively do ecosystem-based oceans manage-
ment. The project addresses both the use and conservation aspects of 
sustainable development.

Two sets of questions here address the substance and process of 
putting ecosystem-based oceans management to work, respectively:
which practices and approaches have proved useful in moving towards 
effective protection and sustainable use of the Arctic marine environ-
ment?

What are the main obstacles, and what are the important success ele-
ments in moving towards ecosystem-based oceans management?

The issue of practices and approaches in ecosystem-based oceans 
management is addressed on the basis of descriptions provided by 
the Arctic countries on how they are actually doing this. Among the 
elements considered are how countries define ecosystem-based oceans 
management, the types of objectives that are formulated, the choice of 
policy instruments and organization of the work, for example in terms 
of how stakeholders are consulted and the geographical context for 

ecosystem-based oceans management, including existing transbound-
ary agreements relevant to the management of Arctic marine ecosys-
tems. 

The question of obstacles and success elements is considered by ask-
ing the Arctic countries to describe their experiences in applying an 
ecosystem-based approach to oceans management. Important elements 
here include the process aspects of interagency cooperation and the or-
ganization of that, the organization and use of science, and stakeholder 
involvement, as well as the actual content of ecosystem-based oceans 
management, such as institutions for ecosystem-based oceans manage-
ment, legislation and policy tools, geographical approaches, including 
LMEs, and biodiversity considerations.

The main emphasis of the project is on the analytical aspects of these 
issues, so that actions can be based on lessons learnt and possible best 
practices identified. 

The project build on previous assessments and work under the Arctic 
Council, and will neither venture into new studies of the Arctic marine 
environment, nor address issues relating to jurisdictions and rights to 
resources. 

The case studies
The project is built around seven case studies of how countries develop 
and implement ecosystem-based oceans management in the Arctic. 
The seven cases – Canada, Denmark/Greenland, Finland, Iceland, 
Norway, Russia and USA – demonstrate that the Arctic countries in-
deed are implementing ecosystem approaches to oceans management. 
In addition, there is a chapter on indigenous issues. The final chapter 
lays out Observed Best Practices that can be subsumed from the case 
studies.

International context
The growth of rule-based, as opposed to power-based, interactions 
among countries in oceans affairs, is a definite characteristic of the 
international oceans regime that developed over the last decades. Com-
mencing with the 1958 UN Conference on the Law of the Sea (UN-
CLOS I), a broad framework regulating almost all uses of the oceans 
has emerged. UNCLOS III (1973–1982) introduced the concept of 
the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), which set the stage for a major 
reconfiguration of rights to natural resources and the development of a 
coastal state based system of resource management regimes, laid down 
in the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention. The Convention entered into 
force in 1994, and is broadly considered to reflect customary interna-
tional law in this realm. 

In relation to living marine resources, the Law of the Sea Convention 
has beed elaborated upon and made more specific by the 1995 UN Fish 
Stocks Agreement, which obliges countries to apply a precautionary 
approach and a ecosystems approach to fisheries management. Also in 
relation to fisheries, the 1995 FAO Code of Conduct of Responsible 
Fisheries and the international action plans adopted to further the im-
plementation of the code at national and regional levels are important.5 

The United Nations General Assembly has repeatedly called for the 
introduction of ecosystem-based oceans management in its annual 
resolutions on oceans and the Law of the Sea. Also, in 2006, the 
United Nations Informal Consultations on Oceans and the Law of the 
Sea (UNICPOLOS) developed a set of “Agreed Consensual Elements” 
on ecosystem approaches and the oceans, that was forwarded to the 
General Assembly 6.
 
Also relevant in in relation to marine questions in general and living 
marine resources in particular is the 1992 Biodiversity Convention. 
The convention is very general in its approach, and relies on countries 
to develop plans for its implementation. Protected areas are a key 
measure in this regard. Specific measures concerning the marine envi-
ronment were adopted in 1995.7 A marine program of work has been in 
effect for several years, and was extended until 2010 at the meeting of 
the parties in 2004.

Other global, marine treaties regulate shipping-related activities and 
pollution. The 1972 London Dumping Convention regulates the dis-
charge of waste from vessels into the ocean, and the 1973 MARPOL 
Convention stipulates the standards vessels engaged in international 
shipping has to comply with. The International Maritime Organiza-
tion (IMO) has adopted a number of global agreements to protect 
the marine environment from negative impacts of marine transport, 
dealing with certifications as well as oil pollution damage, anti-fouling 
systems, ships ballast water and sediment, carriage of hazardous and 
noxious substances etc.

Beyond these global instruments, international cooperation on the 
protection of the ocean environment is based on regional institutions. 

In the northeast Atlantic, measures to protect the marine environment 
are based on the 1992 Convention for the Protection of the Marine 
Environment of the North-East Atlantic (OSPAR Convention).8 The 
work of the convention is organized under five strategies based on 
the five annexes to the convention: land-based pollution, dumping, 
ocean-based pollution, environmental assessments, and conservation 
of ecosystems and biodiversity. The annexes and measures adopted 
by OSPAR are the basis for domestic implementation.  Of particular 
importance is to marine conservation is the work of the Biodiversity 
Committee, which includes ecological quality objectives (EcoQOs), 
assessments of species and habitats in need of protection, and marine 
protected areas. 

For air pollution and its consequences for the marine environment, 
the two global treaties of importance are the 1997 Kyoto Protocol to 
the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 
and the 1979 United Nations Economic Commission for Europe 
Convention on Long-range Transport of Air Pollution (LRTAP) and its 
protocols. The Kyoto Protocol specifies permitted emission levels of 
greenhouse gases and timeframes for achieving reductions for industri-
alized countries. 

A number of “soft law” arrangements that supplement legally binding 
agreements have gained in importance over the years. These include 
Agenda 21, in particular chapter 17 on oceans, and the WSSD 2002 Jo-
hannesburg Plan of Implementation that provides specific guidance to 
governments in developing their ocean policy. The latter in particular 
“Encourage the application by 2010 of the ecosystem approach, noting 
the Reykjavik Declaration on Responsible Fisheries in the Marine 
Ecosystem and decision 5/6 of the Conference of Parties to the Con-
vention on Biological Diversity;”9

Such soft law arrangements also exist at the regional level. In the 
north-east Atlantic region the most important arrangements are the 
North Sea Conference and the Arctic Council. Both of these bodies 
have emphasized the importance of the ecosystem-based approach to 
oceans management.

The “ecosystem approach” has been developed and incorporated in 
several international agreements over the past ten years and has an 
important place in the follow-up to the Convention on Biological 
Diversity. Under this Convention, general criteria have been developed 
for the implementation of the ecosystem approach to the management 
Malawi Principles). 

5 International plans of action haven been developed for overcapacity in 
 fisheries, by-catch of seabirds and sharks, and for targeting illegal, unreported  
 and unregulated (IUU) fishing.

Introduction
One [whaling] captain [on St. Lawrence Island, Alaska] discussed yaa-
yasitkegpenaan, a term describing the appropriate treatment of animals 
and all life surrounding the Yupik. Proper behavior includes harvesting 
no more than one needs, not killing an animal that cannot be retrieved, 
and keeping the environment clean both for the animals and for future 
generations of islanders. [Another] whaling captain described the 
impacts of moving away from yaayasitkegpenaan, sometimes by the 
imposition of external regulatory regimes. … This [new] regulatory 
system created stress, diminished happiness, and created distrust and 
anxiety not only towards the government but also among islanders. 
The conflict between traditional values and modern regulations … still 
remains. (Noongwook et al. 2007: 52)

For indigenous peoples along arctic coastlines, the ocean has always 
been a source of life. Food, clothing, building materials, tools — 
all these have come from the ocean and the animals that live in it. 
Preserving this source of well being is a theme in many traditional 
stories and the basis for the ethics that govern how people interact with 
the sea and its inhabitants. In some respects, these values are closely 
aligned with modern notions of conservation and natural resource 
management. In other respects, their views of human relations with the 
sea are very different, at times incompatible with western notions (Jull 
1990, Morrow and Hensel 1992, Berkes et al. 2005). In this paper, we 
discuss the basis for indigenous beliefs and practices regarding oceans 
and marine resources, the significant issues today for indigenous peo-
ples, and challenges in achieving effective oceans management from 
indigenous points of view. Most of the examples used here are from 
North America and Greenland, in large part due to the greater avail-
ability of relevant published material from those regions.

The intent of this paper is to provide a general introduction to 
indigenous understanding, beliefs, and values with respect to oceans 
management. While indigenous peoples along arctic coasts may face 
the same general environmental threats as everyone else, the causes 
and impacts may be seen and felt differently. These differences in 
turn affect the ways in which management actions are perceived and 
ultimately the effectiveness of those actions. The question is not one 
of finding or compelling a uniform view of management. Instead, it is 
a question of understanding divergent views and developing strategies 
that accommodate such differences in order to achieve a common goal 
of stewarding marine resources for this and also for future generations. 
Compromise and change may be required by some or all of those 
involved, but should be the result of mutual understanding and respect, 
not of unequal power or inflexibility.

The Meaning of Oceans Management to Indigenous 
Peoples
Although the details of beliefs and practices vary, arctic indigenous 
peoples share a deeply personal, spiritual relationship with the animals 
they know and use, a relationship built on ethics that govern who can 
hunt, how, and what is to be done with the animal afterwards (e.g. 
Bodenhorn 1989, Nuttall 1992, Fienup-Riordan 2000). Often, the ani-
mal is seen to give itself to the hunter, offering its flesh and body while 
its soul remains intact. The soul is then able to return to bodily form. If 
the body is treated properly, the animal is likely to be willing to make a 
gift of itself again. If not, it may remain out of reach of people. 
The foundation for this relationship between hunter and hunted is 
respect. The hunter must show respect for the animal at all times, 
recognizing that the decision to give itself is made by the animal, not 
by the hunter. Yupik bowhead whalers on St. Lawrence Island, Alaska, 
recognize a specific behavior of the whales, known as angyi, from the 
stem ang-, which refers to giving something (Noongwook et al. 2007). 
The whale swims alongside the walrus-skin whaling boat, on the left 
side of the boat, where the harpooner cannot strike. The whale may 
stay there for an hour, perhaps looking at each person in the boat, one 
after another. If the whale is satisfied, it will surface on the right side 
where it can be taken. If it is not satisfied, it will swim away out of 
reach. The failure to take a whale that offers itself would be consid-
ered as offensive as the arrogant claim that the whaler, not the whale, 
determines the outcome of angyi. 

This understanding of the basis for hunting success leads to expecta-
tions of appropriate behavior by hunters (and often by their families 

as well). Wenzel (1991: 135) provides an example from Clyde River, 
Nunavut, Canada, showing the personal nature of such behavior:

 Sometimes such actions elude the most careful 
 observation since spiritual preparation for hunting is often   
 private and individual. Clyde harvesters often note that a man  
 can harvest successfully only if he always seeks animals with  
 the right thought (isuma) in his mind. By this they mean that  
 the hunter must always think about the animal he hunts, speak  
 correctly about it, never in a deprecating or negative way, and  
 be generous with the product of his efforts.

The responsiveness of animals to human activity and speech is de-
scribed by Morrow and Hensel (1992: 43), who analyze discussions 
concerning salmon management in southwestern Alaska: “By speaking 
of the fish positively, the Yupiit hope to assure their continuance and to 
prevent realization of the negative prognoses of non-Native manag-
ers.” In other words, speaking of a decline in fish is tantamount to 
causing that decline, because the fish are aware of what is said about 
them. Similarly, the Yupik (and many other indigenous peoples) are 
appalled at the idea of catch-and-release fishing, because it is seen as 
just playing with or rejecting a fish that has willingly given itself to the 
fisherman.

In both directions, then, the essential aspects of the human-animal re-
lationship are personal and individual. Humans as a group do not hunt 
animals as a group. Animals as a group do not respond to the actions 
of humans as a group. Neither people nor animals are interchangeable 
units. 

One result is that notions of population management may translate 
poorly to indigenous conceptions of human-animal relationships. As 
indicated in the quote that opens this paper, management systems can 
be seen as interfering with traditional values and practices. In that 
example, the imposition of a quota on the whale harvest implied that 
people rather than whales had the power to determine the outcome of 
the hunt. Furthermore, limitations on a harvest can lead to competi-
tion between hunters, an attitude that is contrary to behavioral norms 
of cooperation and humility. By breaking the bond between humans 
and animals, harvest regulations can be seen as causing rather than 
responding to population declines. 

Overcoming fundamental differences in worldview is not a trivial mat-
ter. Morrow and Hensel (1992) describe the lasting misunderstanding 
and distrust between Yupik fishermen and fishery managers, stemming 
in part from the fact that both groups used similar words to describe 
concepts and phenomena that were in fact very different. They provide 
an example regarding geese in the same region, concerning the impacts 
of biological studies that involve capturing geese or handling eggs. 
While Yupik concerns may appear to be closely related to biological 
concepts of reproductive success, “it is not reproductive success per 
se which is the issue; rather, it is the response of sentient beings who, 
being affronted, make themselves unavailable to humans” (p. 43). A 
quick appraisal of local concerns could easily frame the problem in 
biological rather than ethical terms, missing the scale of the divide in 
understanding.

Nonetheless, common ground can be found in some cases. The Alaska 
Eskimo Whaling Commission (AEWC), which among other things 
allocates and administers the quota for bowhead whales, is comprised 
of Yupik and Iñupiaq whalers from the ten bowhead whaling villages 
in Alaska. The quota has been a source of considerable and lasting 
controversy and bitterness, but the co-management system that has 
developed is also a source of considerable pride to many of the whal-
ers (Huntington 1992). AEWC Chairman Eddie Hopson explained his 
views at a whaling captains’ meeting in 1990:

 Man’s first responsibility is his dominion over animals given by
  God. That means management, not wastefulness. Management 
 agencies like the AEWC, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, 
 the National Marine Fisheries Service, the International Whaling  
 Commission – they are all doing the job given to us by the Creator, 
 so I do not object to them. (Quoted in Huntington 1992: 115)

A crucial aspect of such a view is the development of collaboration, 
communication, and trust over time. Huntington et al. (2002) note that

a sense of shared enterprise and a willingness to listen to one another 
are hallmarks of successful interactions between indigenous hunters 
and non-indigenous scientists and managers, and that such successes 
are built over time by the individuals involved. Fienup-Riordan (1999) 
found, in regard to goose research and management, that “research 
projects perceived as responsive to local concerns in all stages—plan-
ning, implementation, and review—stand a much greater chance of 
eliciting community cooperation and support” (p. 20).

A related aspect of indigenous perspectives on oceans management 
(and indeed many other topics) is the holistic or systemic way of con-
sidering a particular issue. In other words, a particular topic is typically 
considered in the broader context of the community or society (e.g., 
Jull 1990). The implications of a particular course of action may be 
far-reaching, with the result that a solution that appeared obvious upon 
first examination may not be considered optimal upon further consid-
eration. This idea includes both a holistic view of the environment, 
similar in some respects to the idea of “ecosystem management,” and 
the inclusion of human society as part of the system. 

Diduck et al. (2005) provide an example concerning polar bear 
management in Nunavut. Estimates of the population size of the 
M’Clintock Channel polar bear population had decreased sharply, indi-
cating that the harvest quota was too high. One proposed management 
action was to stop the hunt altogether. The Nunavut Wildlife Manage-
ment Board (NWMB) opted instead for reducing the quota over two 
years, to avoid hardship and resentment in the affected communities. 
Only one community, Gjoa Haven, had no quota for another popula-
tion of polar bears. Accordingly, the NWMB included a re-evaluation 
of the Gulf of Boothia polar bear population and a decision to allow 
Gjoa Haven residents a quota of three bears from that population, so 
that they would not lose their hunting opportunity entirely. The social 
dimensions of the management action were an important part of the 
NWMB’s deliberations.

Indigenous perspectives on human-environmental relations and on the 
implications of management actions are a crucial factor in the develop-
ment of effective and lasting conservation measures. Approaches that 
ignore indigenous worldviews and clash with traditional values and be-
havior are unlikely to gain local support, leading to continued friction 
and distrust. Approaches that recognize those worldviews and foster a 
collaborative response to conservation concerns are likely to create a 
lasting system based on respect and trust. Indigenous people and scien-
tists may not always agree in the abstract, but strong personal relation-
ships can help create mutual understanding and a recognition of shared 
interests. Indeed, many of the major issues in oceans management in 
the Arctic require a collaborative approach if indigenous voices are to 
be heard and indigenous concerns addressed.

Significant Issues in Oceans Management for 
Indigenous Peoples
In former times, the ocean provided food, clothing, materials, and 
other necessities for survival in the Arctic. Proper behavior and action, 
as described in the preceding section, were required to sustain the 
relationship between people and animals. This outlook was concerned 
with one’s local area and a relatively short-term perspective. Indeed, 
advance planning was often regarded as unnecessary because the sea 
would provide at the appropriate times of the year (e.g., Briggs 1970, 
Natcher et al., in press).

Today, addressing local actions alone is no longer adequate. The prolif-
eration of management institutions across the Arctic is one indication 
of the extent and significance of the many conservation issues facing 
the region today. The level of indigenous participation, from local 
committees and boards through to international activity in the Arctic 
Council and United Nations, is a similar indication of the importance 
that Arctic indigenous peoples place on conservation and management 
in general and specifically on playing an active role in what is done. 

Here we consider three categories of topics and their relationship with 
indigenous peoples of the arctic coasts: disturbance, harvests, and self-
determination. Which issues are of primary importance varies from 
place to place and from time to time, and even from person to person. 
We will not attempt to assess local priorities, or even to evaluate which 

of these three categories is most pressing on regional or circumpolar 
scales. Instead, we address the nature of the issue, its significance to 
indigenous peoples, and what it means for oceans management.

Disturbance
Disturbance is the broadest of the topics, covering all forms of impacts 
to the environment and society that result in unwelcome changes to 
the sea and its resources, and their relationships with humans. Climate 
change is the most prominent disturbance in research and in media 
coverage, but industrial activity, shipping, commercial fishing, and 
pollution are also included. Societal change is part of the equation, too, 
but will be addressed in more detail when we discuss self-determina-
tion.

Disturbance from any cause can upset the movements and behavior of 
fish, birds, and mammals. This can affect the health of the animals and 
also their distribution, with resulting effects on people. For example, 
shifts in ocean currents and climate caused a decline in cod abundance 
in West Greenland, while making ideal conditions for shrimp. Hamil-
ton et al. (2003) describe how the town of Sisimiut was able to switch 
from cod fishing to shrimp trawling, resulting in economic growth. 
Paamiut, farther south, experienced the switch later, by which time 
there was no opportunity to enter the shrimp fishery. As a consequence, 
Paamiut’s population declined.

Disturbance can also affect travel and other human activity, for 
example by creating physical barriers or by making travel on sea ice 
unsafe. Indigenous knowledge has been built around experience and 
understanding of patterns in the natural world. Such knowledge allows 
people to live in the rhythms of the land and sea, to know where to find 
what they need at any particular time. When those patterns change, 
it may be difficult to adjust. Huntington and Fox (2005) describe 
several examples from climate change around the Arctic, pointing to 
disruption of expected patterns and customary practices. The National 
Research Council (2003) describes how whalers in northern Alaska 
have had to go farther out to sea because bowhead whales have been 
deflected in their migration by offshore oil and gas activity. This 
change entails considerably more risk for the whalers and can affect 
the quality of the harvested food since towing the whale to shore may 
take longer, increasing the chance that the meat may spoil.

As various forms of human influence and activity become more 
prominent in the Arctic, disturbance becomes greater and its impacts 
more severe. The combination of factors is perhaps most worrisome, 
particularly in areas where activities are most intensive and overlaps 
most common. For example, offshore oil and gas activity is begin-
ning in the Chukchi Sea (AMAP, in press), and the region will also be 
directly on the route of cargo ships transiting the Northern Sea Route 
(Brigham and Ellis 2004). The Barents Sea, at the other end of the 
cargo route, is already seeing large-scale oil and gas activity, together 
with tanker transport of oil from Russia to Europe (Bambulyak and 
Frantzen 2007). Commercial fisheries (Vilhjálmsson and Hoel 2005) 
may reach both areas, along with Baffin Bay, where more oil and gas 
activity is possible. 

Activities on this scale within the Arctic will also add to pollution 
problems caused by industry and agriculture elsewhere in the world. 
The Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Program has documented the 
extent of contaminants in the Arctic and their effects on plants, ani-
mals, and people (AMAP 1998, 2004). Oil and gas activity, shipping, 
cruise ships, and commercial fisheries are likely to add to contaminant 
levels. Several large rivers in the Arctic carry contaminants from 
southern areas, delivering the effects of distant activity directly to es-
tuaries and coasts that provide essential habitats for marine species and 
are also home to many indigenous communities. Pollution undermines 
the relationship between people and their environment, casting doubt 
on the healthfulness of traditional foods, and demonstrating a lack of 
respect for animals. In many communities, young hunters share their 
first catch with elders. If the hunters fear the animal is contaminated or 
unhealthy, they may be reluctant to offer it to an elder. 

Invasive species are another form of disturbance, often a secondary 
effect from habitat change. Some arrivals may be welcomed or at 
least offer some benefits, such as salmon appearing in the Beaufort

Sea (e.g., Berkes and Jolly 2001). Other newcomers may be less 
desirable, particularly parasites and diseases (Burek et al. in press). 
For people dependent upon the fish and animals of their local waters, 
invasive species and diseases pose a substantial threat. One example 
is the increased prevalence of the fungus ichthyophonus affecting king 
salmon in the Yukon River (Kocan et al. 2003), harming an important 
source of food and income for people throughout the watershed. The 
increase is believed to be due to rising water temperatures associated 
with climate change.

Disturbance thus has many and far-reaching implications for indig-
enous peoples. The multitude of causes makes management a complex 
matter, for restrictions on one factor may have no benefit if other 
factors remain beyond control. Types of disturbance vary greatly, too, 
from the localized impacts of a single drilling rig to the global impacts 
of long-range pollution and climate change. Addressing the causes of 
disturbance and reducing its cumulative impacts will take coordinated 
management. For indigenous peoples, one of the key goals is effective 
involvement in such management, a topic to which we return later in 
this paper.

Harvest levels and allocations
The myth of the inexhaustible sea is persistent but illusionary (Roberts 
2007). While the resources of the sea have sustained arctic coastal peo-
ples since time immemorial, the patterns of species and harvests have 
also varied considerably in response to environmental shifts and the 
development of new hunting and fishing technologies (e.g., Krupnik 
1993). Food security, the reliable ability to provide for one’s family 
and community, has long been the goal of indigenous harvest strate-
gies. In an uncertain and variable environment, patterns of use could 
vary considerably from year to year, but access to a range of resources 
and options was a key component of resilience (e.g., Nuttall  2005). 

In more recent times, other factors have influenced harvest patterns 
and levels. Local and distant markets for marine products have stimu-
lated indigenous involvement in fisheries and hunts (e.g., Bockstoce 
1986, Marquardt and Caulfield 1996). The loss of those markets, from 
economic or political causes, has often caused hardship for those who 
previously had relied on income from their catches, as happened when 
sealskin markets in the United States and the European Union were 
closed by import bans (e.g., Wenzel 1991, Lynge 1992). Ecological 
change has also led to harvest changes, as noted earlier regarding cod 
and shrimp in West Greenland. Markets have also created new forms 
of resource use, such as the Soviet-era harvest of gray whales in Chu-
kotka, Russia, to provide meat for fox farms along the coast (Sander 
1992, Kerttula 2000).

Perhaps the most widespread factor, however, has been the develop-
ment of various management regimes for fishing and hunting in the 
Arctic (e.g., Huntington 1992, Caulfield 1997, 2004, Klein 2005). 
Seasons, limits, acceptable methods, and other restrictions on hunting 
and fishing are not often simple to apply to traditional practices in 
indigenous communities in the Arctic. Designed largely for recrea-
tional uses, these regulations typically ignore important features of 
arctic production systems. For example, a small number of hunters in 
a community are usually responsible for the majority of the production 
of fish and meat (e.g., Magdanz et al. 2002). Restricting individual har-
vests in such a situation, even if the potential community-wide harvest 
remained the same, would make it difficult for a community to meet 
its needs because not everyone is able to participate equally in a hunt. 
Community limits, which have been used in some locations for some 
species, avoid this problem. 

While many regulatory approaches are less than ideal in the arctic con-
text, unregulated or poorly regulated harvests can also create problems. 
Beluga whales in West Greenland, for example, have declined sharply 
in recent years. This change is attributed by scientists and manag-
ers to overharvest (e.g., Alvarez-Flores and Heide-Jørgensen 2004), 
though this conclusion is disputed by local hunters (e.g., Mølgaard 
2006). From the hunters’ point of view, a large part of the problem 
is poor communication between hunters on one hand and scientists 
and managers on the other. Mølgaard states that communication had 
actually been better prior to the devolution of Home Rule status to the 
Greenland government (see also Sejersen 2002). As noted earlier with 

regard to the management of disturbance, indigenous peoples seek 
more effective involvement in the management of hunting and fishing.
A related problem is that of allocation of harvests among various 
user groups. In the case of personal-use harvests, conflicts may arise 
between local users and those visiting from other areas. In Alaska, for 
example, there is considerable tension between “subsistence” users 
and “sport” users, with contentious definitions of each category (e.g., 
Huntington 1992). For indigenous peoples in Alaska, the situation is 
exacerbated by the fact that “subsistence” users are typically equated 
with rural residents, regardless of ethnicity. (The exception is the case 
of marine mammal hunting, which under the 1972 Marine Mammal 
Protection Act is limited to indigenous Alaskans, who can hunt without 
restriction so long as there is no waste and the stock in question is not 
depleted.) Participation in traditional activities may thus be reduced or 
impossible for indigenous persons who live in cities. Additionally, the 
management of fish and wildlife may favor sport users by restricting 
harvests to certain seasons, methods, sex, or size of fish or animals.
Harvests that involve a commercial element can be, if anything, even 
more contentious. Fisheries allocations have long led to battles at the 
national and even international levels. For indigenous users, particu-
larly in fisheries, it may be difficult to obtain recognition for traditional 
practices or uses when larger economic interests are involved. Cod 
fisheries along the North Norwegian coast are one example. Economi-
cally, large vessels fishing offshore are the most efficient means of 
catching fish. Culturally and in terms of local employment, however, 
inshore fisheries from small boats provide opportunities for coastal 
residents, particularly Saami who have long fished for cod in this man-
ner (Nielssen 1986). After 1990, Norway established a quota system 
for cod fisheries, in which Saami fishermen were included with other 
small boats under a total catch limit. The Saami fishermen felt that 
they could not compete effectively under this system, and have been 
calling for regional fisheries management to prevent the disappearance 
of their fishing traditions (FAO 2005).

In Alaska, concern for local fishermen and communities in the Bering 
Sea spurred the creation of community development quotas, or CDQs, 
administered by six organizations that together include over 50 pre-
dominantly indigenous communities (National Research Council 1999, 
Caulfield 2004). The CDQ groups are allocated a portion of the harvest 
of Pollock, halibut, sablefish, Atka mackerel, Pacific cod, and crab. 
The income from the catch can then be invested in the communities, 
including infrastructure and equipment to support further economic de-
velopment or greater participation in fisheries. While the program has 
not resolved all fisheries issues, it has helped create employment and 
new investment and opportunity derived from fisheries in the region.

A further conflict over harvests concerns use areas. Indigenous hunt-
ers and fishermen often travel over vast areas to provide for their 
families and communities (e.g., Freeman 1976). New activities that 
appear to be distant from existing settlements may still affect residents 
of those settlements. Use areas are at least part of the basis for land 
claims agreements in North America (e.g., Berger 1985). The increase 
in shipping, offshore oil and gas activities, and commercial fisher-
ies all threaten to affect hunters and fishermen. Indirect effects were 
discussed earlier as forms of disturbance affecting the environment. 
Direct effects include obstacles to boat travel, such as causeways, 
and hindrances to hunting and fishing methods. Fishing nets can snag 
on industrial equipment. Firearms cannot be used at sea when many 
people are near, for fear of ricochets off the water. While interference 
with indigenous harvest activities may be unintended, that nonetheless 
can be the result if harvests are forced into smaller areas or hunters and 
fishermen must travel farther.

Self-determination
The environmental and economic dimensions of oceans management 
are important to arctic indigenous peoples, but spanning all such 
considerations is the question of self-determination. When manage-
ment decisions are made elsewhere, for any aspect of society, it is 
difficult for local residents to retain a stake in the outcomes of those 
decisions. One result is passive dependence upon others for economic 
sustenance. Another result is the loss of traditional approaches to 
cultural and environmental stewardship. If a society responds to the 
rules created by others, it is less likely to heed the signals and indica-
tors of opportunities and threats. If, on the other hand, a society bears 

ICAS

15

responsibility for the results of its actions, it is perhaps more likely to 
seek the information and ideas necessary for sound decisions.
The most alarming change over the past century has been the erosion 
of the ability of arctic peoples to determine for themselves what course 
of action to follow. However, there has been in recent decades a grow-
ing awareness in arctic communities of what is at stake, accompanied 
by a push for greater local involvement in all aspects of governance. 
While there has been some progress towards self-determination in 
some areas, such as the establishment of Home Rule in Greenland 
in 1979 and the creation of Nunavut in Canada in 1999, and greater 
involvement in governance in others, arctic communities often lack the 
resources needed to achieve their ambitions (AHDR 2004). Further-
more, national policies and international commitments are not always 
conducive to indigenous self-determination.

On land, land-claims settlements in Alaska and Canada, plus Home 
Rule status in Greenland, have provided some measure of authority 
and property rights to indigenous peoples and their organizations. At 
sea, however, national governments retain ownership of mineral and 
living resources and the power to make decisions about their use and 
development. International disputes over topics such as whether the 
Northwest Passage constitutes international waters have simmered 
for years (e.g., Jull 1990). Climate change and the retreat of sea ice 
have now brought sovereignty issues to the forefront, along with the 
prospects for increased development, shipping, and even commercial 
fishing (AMAP in press, Brigham and Ellis 2004, Vilhjálmsson and 
Hoel 2005).

For indigenous peoples, these are not necessarily positive develop-
ments. In addition to the various types of disturbance described earlier, 
greater economic and political attention to the Arctic may mean an 
influx of new and competing interests. In some areas with extensive 
development, indigenous peoples have become outnumbered by new 
migrants (AMAP 1998, in press, AHDR 2004). Geographical margin-
alization at least had the benefit of minimal competition for resources 
and the potential for being left alone. To become marginalized within 
one’s homeland, however, is another story. In the rush to claim and ex-
ploit arctic marine resources, indigenous peoples are once again faced 
with the prospect of being pushed aside while others make decisions 
and take actions that will have far-reaching consequences for residents 
of arctic coasts.

Challenges in Oceans Management from the 
Indigenous Perspective
The overwhelming challenge for arctic indigenous peoples is the sheer 
scope of oceans management issues today and in the decades to come. 
The recurring theme in indigenous perspectives on oceans manage-
ment is the desire to be involved in all phases of management, from 
identifying problems to evaluating response options to deciding what 
actions are taken to monitoring the effectiveness of those actions and 
making modifications as needed. Marine issues affect coastal peoples 
directly and personally, through traditional activities, the nutritional 
and cultural benefits of food from the sea, and their very identities as 
peoples. Simply put, they have everything at stake.

At the same time, however, many indigenous communities and peoples 
are few in number. Many companies or government agencies have 
more employees than an entire arctic ethnic group has members. There 
simply are not enough people to address every oceans management 
issue separately. Furthermore, many communities lack the resources 
and capacity to address even the issues they see as priorities. Many 
indigenous leaders are overworked already. Hiring others to help can 
help, but requires additional financial resources plus cultural and other 
training. Finally, the creation of management organizations can have 
unintended and unexpected social consequences. In this section, we 
look at three topics: capacity, organizational structure, and societal 
change. Together, these topics point the way to more effective oceans 
management practices from the indigenous point of view.

Capacity
Oceans management addressing the many issues outlined above 
entails many agencies, organizations, and companies, producing tens 
of thousands of pages of reports and analyses, based on hundreds or 

thousands of scientific and other studies, to be discussed at a seem-
ingly endless procession of meetings, conferences, consultations, and 
hearings, each dedicated to one small part of one particular issue. 
Taking part in all the meetings relevant to even a single issue requires 
more than one person dedicated to that task alone can handle. For 
most indigenous and other local organizations in the Arctic, this is 
rarely possible. Instead, people must choose which events to attend, 
which issues to study in depth, and what they can hope to accomplish. 
In many respects, this is the same position that nearly all participants 
in management processes must address. For indigenous communi-
ties, however, the problem is exacerbated by the breadth of issues of 
concern and the limited capacity available.

Let us take the example of Yupik and Iñupiaq Eskimo whalers in 
northern Alaska (see Huntington [1992] for further discussion). In 
1977, the International Whaling Commission (IWC) voted to stop 
the centuries-old hunt for the bowhead whale, basing the decision on 
estimated harvest levels and the available minimum estimates for the 
whale population. The whalers argued that the population was higher 
that the IWC recognized and that it was growing. The U.S. government 
and the local government (North Slope Borough), working with the 
Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission, conducted a number of studies, 
designed in part on observations made by the whalers. The studies 
showed that the population was indeed larger than estimated and in 
fact was growing. But this was only the first step.

Next, the whalers had to persuade the U.S. government to seek a larger 
quota, and then convince the IWC to approve that quota. This entailed 
participating in the annual IWC meeting, held at various locations 
around the world, as well as preparatory meetings with the U.S. dele-
gation. The IWC, while accepting the improved population estimates, 
asked for more information on cultural need and killing methods, 
which in turn required additional studies and programs. The story 
does not end with the Alaska whalers, however. The IWC also governs 
whaling by other nations, and the Alaskans can find themselves caught 
in international politics (see brief overview in Noongwook et al. 
[2007]). Sometimes more study is required, and sometimes political 
and diplomatic work is necessary. In both cases, the whalers cannot 
afford to stand aside, but must take part in all phases to make sure their 
voice is heard.

And the IWC is only one aspect of bowhead whaling. As noted earlier, 
offshore oil and gas activity is a major concern for the whalers, both 
for access to and for the health of the whales. The Beaufort and Chuk-
chi Seas have seen extensive offshore exploration and, in the case of 
the Beaufort, the beginnings of development and production (AMAP 
in press). The Minerals Management Service holds lease sales, each 
of which is preceded by an environmental impact statement, including 
public review periods and meetings. Oil companies also hold meetings, 
seeking agreements with the whaling communities about avoiding 
conflicts on the water. Other reviews and studies of impacts from 
noise, pollution, shipping, and so on are underway, each requiring 
some level of attention and scrutiny. It should also be remembered that 
much of the public process is devoted, not to the question of whether 
offshore activity should proceed at all, but to details of the conditions 
under which will occur, spreading local capacity ever thinner across 
the minutiae of regulations. 

While extensive processes for public involvement are appropriate (and 
certainly better than little or no public involvement), the cumulative 
burden on the whalers and the associated scientific and legal teams is 
extremely high. Hiring more people could help, if the resources to do 
so were available. Combining environmental assessments or reviews 
to reduce the numbers of documents and meetings could also help. 
Another option, deciding not to participate in some meetings or events, 
may also be a necessity, but with the risk that the whalers are ignored 
because they are not present. This was part of the reason that the IWC 
ban was enacted in 1977, and the whalers are unlikely to want a repeat 
through inattention. Shipping, commercial fishing, contaminants, and 
climate change are also part of the picture for bowhead whales, now 
or in the next few decades. There is little reason to think that the issue 
will become simpler or the consequences lower. 

Bowhead whales are only one example. Alaska hunters are also 
concerned with impacts to other marine mammals, to seabirds, and to

fish. Saami fishermen along the Barents Sea coast have a similar suite 
of issues to contend with and a similar range of management regimes, 
including international agreements. Hunters in West Greenland and the 
eastern Canadian Arctic likewise share stocks of many species, creat-
ing both international and domestic elements of management policy 
and practice in areas where commercial fisheries and offshore oil and 
gas activities are on the horizon. Capacity to engage effectively and 
meaningfully in management regimes depends in part on the structure 
of those regimes, as discussed next.

Organizational structure
A multitude of management issues need not lead to a proliferation 
of management regimes. Indeed, the notion of “ecosystem manage-
ment” suggests that fewer management bodies working more closely 
together is a better idea than a fragmented system in which no agency 
or organization has the ability to consider all aspects of management 
together. There are, however, few examples of such coordination or 
consolidation. One of the better ones is in the Inuvialuit Settlement 
Region in Canada’s Northwest Territories. Under the terms of the 
land claim settlement, the Government of Canada, the Government of 
the Northwest Territories, the Yukon Territorial Government, and the 
community and regional Inuvialuit organizations participate in five co-
management groups. These groups govern fishing and hunting as well 
as environmental impact screening and review (Smith 2001). 

Following the provisions of Canada’s 1997 Oceans Act, which calls 
for integrated and precautionary management of oceans and coastal 
waters, the Inuvialuit, the governments, and the oil and gas industry 
developed the Beaufort Sea Integrated Management Planning Initiative 
(BSIMPI; see Fast et al. 2005). The initiative focused to start with on 
evaluating the idea of a marine protected area to conserve three areas 
of important beluga whale and fish habitats in the Mackenzie Delta. 
Though not without challenges, a three-year period of consultations 
with Inuvialuit, governments, and industry led to better mutual under-
standing and the identification of solutions that are acceptable to all 
stakeholders. As Fast et al. (2005: 113) describe:

 There has been a better definition of issues and problems. 
 Communities, Inuvialuit management and co-management 
 bodies, industry, and government agencies, including DFO 
 [Department of Fisheries and Oceans, Canada], have a better  
 understanding of the complexities of balancing conservation  
 and development in the complex offshore environment of the  
 Beaufort Sea. Access to information and understanding beyond  
 a single realm such as science has been achieved. … Ultimately,  
 the objective of integrated management is to influence human  
 behaviour. This is the realm that has been advanced through the  
 BSIMPI consultation process.

The BSIMPI is designed to address industrial development, but to do 
so in the full context of what such development may mean to the indig-
enous communities of the region. The accommodation of all aspects of 
local concerns is an essential component of this approach, ensuring the 
Inuvialuit that their views will be heard and taken into account. Some 
compromise will undoubtedly be necessary on all sides, but those deci-
sions can be made in light of all relevant information that can be gath-
ered, and through a structure in which power is shared. It should also 
be noted that the BSIMPI had considerable resources to work with, 
and extensive local experience in management processes thanks to the 
co-management groups established under the land claim settlement.

Elsewhere in the Arctic there are other examples of cooperative and 
co-management regimes (e.g., Huntington 1992, Caulfield 1997, 2004, 
Freeman et al. 1998, Hovelsrud and Winsnes 2006), but these usually 
address single species or issues rather than taking an integrated ap-
proach to oceans management. Still, the cooperative approach offers 
many advantages, including sharing of power and the ability to address 
various issues in relation to, rather than independent of, one another. 
Many such bodies have only advisory or otherwise limited author-
ity, and as such cannot necessarily influence the full range of issues 
and threats they identify. Nonetheless, they have succeeded in many 
respects in providing a means for indigenous peoples to express their 
views and to be engaged in the management process.

Societal change
As noted by Noongwook et al. (2007) in the quote with which this 
paper opens, management regimes can conflict with traditional values. 
This remains true even for the most participatory regimes, if man-
agement actions run counter to traditional views of the relationship 
between people and the fish and animals that sustain them. In addition 
to helping conserve marine resources, management regimes can also 
promote cultural assimilation and even co-optation by enlisting indig-
enous participants in fulfilling the goals of the management agency 
with whom final authority rests (e.g., Nadasdy 2004). 

Management regimes can also create social divisions within communi-
ties, as some individuals gain authority and stature by participation 
or employment within a management agency or body (e.g., Caulfield 
1997). In a time when social and cultural change are rapid and pro-
found, further drivers of change, even if inadvertent, are unlikely to 
have a long-term benefit for the communities involved. Instead, just 
as the full range of oceans management issues should be considered in 
making decisions about conservation measures, the full range of social 
impacts should be considered in determining how to create manage-
ment organizations. Oceans management is a large topic, but only 
one of many interwoven aspects of life in today’s arctic indigenous 
societies. It cannot be considered separately, but must be recognized 
as an integral part of a larger whole: the present and future of Arctic 
indigenous peoples.

Summary
The chapter describes the Russian Arctic seas as an object of man-
agement starting out with a description of their physical- and bio-
geographical features with special attention to LMEs and fisheries as 
the main resource usage. The chapter addresses also the current stage 
of other kinds of marine economic activities such as cargo shipping 
and oil and gas production and their prospects, as well as some social 
problems of the modern Russian Arctic.

The chapter then describes current federal legislation established, 
executive institutions responsible for the national marine policy devel-
opment process and peculiarities of the policy formation and realiza-
tion. The next steps suggested on the way to real implementation of 
integrated approaches, first of all at the federal level, are considered.

1. Introduction
Russia is by right considered and remains one of the leading maritime 
nations. A historical feature of Russia is its aspiration to the sea, to 
operate, develop and research its expanses and resources. The Russians 
started developing coasts and islands of the White and Barents Seas as 
far back as the XII century. In the middle of the XVI century (under 
Tsar Ivan the Terrible) the Muscovite Russia started active expansion 
to the north and east. Later in the XVI century and in the first half of 
the next one, future Russian towns were established in the Arctic.

With coasts bordering three oceans, the modern Russia with total land 
area of 17.1 million km² and the population of 142 mln people) has 
one of the most extended coastlines in the world (61 000 km without 
small islands) including the Arctic coast of 39 940 km (Fig. 1.1, Table 
1.1).

The marine border of Russia running along the external boundary of 
the territorial sea has length of over 38 000 km. The area of the exclu-
sive economic zone is over 6 mln km2. 

Situated in different climatic zones ranging from Arctic to subtrop-
ics, Russia’s coastal zone is characterized by strong heterogeneity in 
natural, geographic and socio-economic parameters influencing the 
character of maritime activity. Thus, it is necessary to mention that 
approximately 17 million people populate the country’s coastal zone 
(about 12% of the total population) of which 45% live in the coastal 

zone of the Black, Azov and Baltic seas (which accounts for only 2% 
of the entire coastal zone area), whereas only 15% live in the coastal 
zone of the Arctic regions (which accounts for 67% of the entire 
coastal zone area). 

Fundamental changes in the socio-economic and political structure of 
Russia started in the 1990s have undoubtedly had essential influence 
on its maritime activity too. Complex situational analysis of economic 
activity by regional components of the coastal zone and seas of Russia 
have showed ineffective use of resources and depressive state of the 
environment in almost all the coastal provinces of Russia as well as the 
necessity to change the organization of the nature management and the 
character of interactions between the involved parties – resource users, 
population and authorities [1].

2. Geographical information and ecosystem 
characteristics
The following large marine ecosystems are defined in the Russian 
Arctic: Barents Sea, Kara Sea, Laptev Sea, East Siberian Sea, and 
Chukchee Sea. There is exact delimitation between the Russian West 
Arctic sector (Barents and Kara seas) and the Russian East Arctic 
sector (Laptev, East-Siberian and Chukchee seas) (Fig. 2.1). The of-
ficial west boundary of the Barents Sea does not coincide with the sea 
boundary of the shelf. The continental slope is clearly pronounced in 
this area, depth increases 500 to 1 000 m each 10-20 km, therefore the 
west boundary of the Barents Sea LME must be laid along the edge of 
the shelf. It may be recommended to be delineated in the first approxi-
mation strictly south along the meridian 16° 30¢ from the southern 
extremity of Spitsbergen Island (Svalbard) down to the Norwegian 
coast. 

The boundary between the Barents Sea and the Kara Sea along the 
Novaya Zemlya (New Land) Archipelago is quite obvious, but rather 
rough to the north of it. There are two hydrographic sections between 
Novaya Zemlya (New Land) and Franz Josef Land, areas of which 
(103 km² and 105 km², respectively) are substantially smaller than the 
area of the section running along the boundary between the Barents 
Sea and the Kara Sea (165 km²). However contrasts of depth and other 
natural factors at this part of the shelf are insignificant, therefore there 
is no need diverging from the official sea boundary in this case.

The shelf of the Russian East Arctic sector represents a single body 
with small depths (less than 50 m) and insignificantly rugged seabed. 
The sea boundary of the shelf coincides approximately with the official 
boundaries of the seas except for the Laptev Sea, where the abyssal 
hollow juts out deeply into the shelf. Taking all this into account, 
the boundary of the Laptev Sea LME could be delineated from Cape 
Chelyuskin to the north-east boundary point 79° N 139° E, i.e. south-
ward of the hydrographical sea boundary. 

River runoff is a chief natural factor for the shelf seas of the Russian 
Arctic. In the Barents Sea this is mostly characteristic of its south-
eastern part, which is sometimes called the Pechora Sea and is the 
shallowest one receiving half of the total inflow of river water with the 
Pechora River runoff. 

River runoff (Ob, Yenisei, Taz and other rivers) is a major factor 
affecting salinity, temperature, ice regime, and levels of man-caused 
contamination in the Kara Sea. The Kara Sea annually receives around 
1 300 cubic km of river runoff which is more than 40% of the total 
runoff into the Arctic Ocean from Eurasia. The Laptev Sea is subject to 
a substantial impact of the river runoff with the Lena River as a major 
source of inflow (520 km3 annually). The East Siberian Sea and the 
Chukchee Sea are less affected by this factor. 

Sea ice is a major natural factor regulating seasonal cycles of pho-
tosynthesis, plankton development, and feeding and migrations of 
commercial fish stocks. Besides, it provides a habitat for some marine 
mammals. The aforementioned LMEs have quite different ice condi-
tions: from total absence of ice to complete ice cover the whole year 
round. 

The Southwest Barents Sea is free of ice all the year round which 
results in high biological productivity, development of fisheries and 
other economic activities. In the North Barents Sea drifting ice occurs 
any time of the year except for July and August when a probability to 
meet ice becomes less than 50 %. 

A complete description of productivity of polar seas including its sea-
sonal changes is not obtained up to now. Many areas either have never 
been visited by expeditions or there are only episodic data on them. 
Thus, until the mid 1990s there were no data available on the state of 
ecosystems in winter and spring for the seas running along the North-
ern Sea Route (East Barents Sea, Kara Sea, Laptev Sea, East Siberian 
Sea, and Chukchee Sea). Based on results of regular monitoring car-
ried out by the Murmansk Marine Biological Institute (MMBI) (Rus-
sia, Murmansk) from Russian nuclear-powered icebreakers navigating 
the Arctic during the whole ice season, a series of new conclusions 
on the structure and function of Arctic ecosystems at different trophic 
levels (plankton communities to marine birds and mammals) has been 
obtained [3].

A sharp decrease in zooplankton and zoobenthos biomass is typical 
of seas of the Russian Arctic east of the Barents Sea. In a deep-water 
Arctic Ocean benthos biomass sharply decreases at a depth of 600-
800 m. Characteristic values of benthos biomass differ five orders of 
magnitude, 0.05-0.1 g/m2 in the Arctic Ocean to 1 000 g/m2 and more 
at some parts of the Barents Sea shelf. On the whole the distribution of 
biomass closely depends on depth therefore the shelf boundaries can 
well be used as boundaries of benthic communities. 

Fish fauna of polar seas is referred to as the circumpolar, Atlantic 
boreal and Pacific boreal according to the modern biogeographical 
zoning. The first one is spread all over the whole Arctic basin and its 
shelf seas, including the northern shelf of the Bering Sea, except for 
the South Barents Sea, which belongs to the Atlantic boreal area. The 
Pacific boreal includes the deep-water part of the Bering Sea. Almost 
all fishing areas are located within boreal areas.

Many fish species undertake long migrations which routes may depend 
on the inter-annual variability of water temperature. In warm years 
the Northeast Arctic cod spreads all over the whole Southeast Barents 
Sea while in cold years it migrates to central and south-western areas. 
Reduction of the cod habitat is accompanied by widening of the distri-
bution area and increase in abundance of the polar cod, a representa-
tive of Arctic fish fauna.

Distribution density of sea birds and marine mammals is also closely 
connected with the level of LME bioproductivity. The most numerous 
rookeries are located in non-freezing coastal zones of Norway and 
Kola Peninsula. For some marine mammals (polar bear, ringed seal 
and others) sea ice provides a natural habitat and a room for migra-
tions, therefore their distribution areas may become narrower or larger 
depending on long-term climatic changes. 

Isolation of trophic connections, being another criterion for the LME 
delimitation, may be considered full only for benthic organisms 
and coastal phytocenoses. Even passively floating phytoplankton is 
advected with currents over large distance and cross LMEs boundaries. 
Representatives of higher trophic levels (fishes, birds, mammals) are 
often not limited by boundaries of particular ecosystems. Many fish 
species undertake passive and active migrations during their life cycle 
(spawn, larvae, juveniles, and mature fish). The general regularity is 
that an increased abundance of representatives of all the trophic levels 
is observed in ocean areas with high levels of primary production 
(upwellings, river estuaries). 

Background contamination in the Barents Sea results from transbound-
ary transport of contaminants entering the sea with the Norwegian 
current from the west and local contamination from land-based sources 
and intensive navigation. Contamination levels in open areas of the 
Barents Sea are significantly lower than those of western and southern

European seas. Exceptions are some coastal areas, especially Kola In-
let housing the largest port and industrial complex in the Arctic. High 
ecological vulnerability is also characteristic of the Southeast Barents 
Sea receiving contaminants from onshore oil and gas production sites 
located in the Pechora River basin. Offshore oil production which will 
start in the near future presents a potential ecological threat to this part 
of the Barents Sea.

River basins are major sources of contaminants for other Arctic seas of 
Russia. The most vulnerable water areas are the White Sea and estua-
rine areas of the Ob River and the Yenisei River in the Kara Sea. 

A specific feature of the Russian Western Arctic sector is a threat of 
radioactive contamination as this region houses a large number of lo-
cal sources of artificial radionuclides and receives contaminants from 
external sources. However in general nowhere in the Arctic chemical 
and radiation contamination is referred to as a major factor affecting 
ecosystems, quality of fish food products and health of sea bird and 
mammal populations which to a greater extent are subject to effects of 
bioaccumulation of toxic substances [4]. 

Arctic seas, compared to other regions of the World Ocean, are 
relatively clean and the state of pelagic (open-sea) ecosystems is as a 
whole stable (apart from overfishing of commercial species). However 
some shelf areas of arctic seas and coastal zones (Kola Inlet in particu-
lar) are substantially contaminated.

Among typical environmental problems in 
the Arctic are: a) specifying quantities of 
contaminants entering the Arctic and shares 
of contribution of their sources; b) studying 
assimilation capacities of single areas to 
the most dangerous contaminants, assess-
ing their impacts on the biotic system; 
c) developing and introducing biological 
and chemical methods to assess effects of 
cumulative impacts of man-caused factors; 
d) developing measures for mitigating im-
pacts of current levels of pollution on man 
and living nature taking into account slow 
character of self purification and restoration 
of arctic ecosystems; e) assessing impacts 
of climatic changes on ecosystems [5].

Special attention should be paid to the 
necessity to enlarge the area of protected 
land and water territories. Some scientists 
believe such areas should occupy 25 % of 
the whole Arctic area. 

3. Socio-economic 
characteristics

Role of macroeconomic processes in 
Russia
Significant economic activity of the USSR 
on its coasts, in the adjacent seas and in the 
open ocean was conducted under condi-
tions of a strictly centralized management 
system, based on a sectoral (ministerial) 
approach and exclusive state ownership of 
land, resources and means of production. 
The sectoral ministries were responsible, 
first of all, for the fulfillment of their own 
plans. Consequently integrated regional 
programs were paid little attention. That 
meant in practice that under conditions 
of the centralized directive management 
system there was no need for sound recom-
mendations on integrated use of coastal 
resources and for objective mechanisms of 
coordination of interests and settlement of 
conflicts between the stakeholders [6].

Characteristic of the transitional stage, fundamental changes happened 
in Russia in the 1990s substantially influenced maritime activities 
as well. These changes include privatization and changed ownership 
patterns, significant revision of the governing role of national, regional 
and local authorities, noticeable weakening of attention to nature con-
servation measures under conditions of poor socio-economic situation. 
Characteristic of a transition period, costs of organization of a new sys-
tem of economic relations– first of all relations between ownership and 
use of natural resources which interconnect national, regional and local 
interests and interests of private business – should also be mentioned. 
Then comes the insufficiency of the respective legislative basis and 
institutional structure for the integrated regional ocean management, 
absence of long-term experience in market regulation. Other things 
– typical for the transition period – that should be mentioned here 
are weak investment policy at different levels, insignificant practical 
demand for results of scientific research and lack of modern coastal 
zone cadastres necessary for effective management [7].

At the same time among positive things is a traditionally high level of 
expertise of specialists in natural sciences, including marine sciences, 
in Russia, and effective system of higher education, and availability 
of access to international experience in integrated approaches to ocean 
management. 

On its way towards the modern political and economic system, Russia 
has gained relative success in solving tasks of two stages of drastic

23

socio-economic reforms. The first stage that occurred in the 1990s was 
directed at dismantling of the old socialist system by that time gone 
through economic, social, political and value crash.

Characterized by a chain of crises dramatically experienced by the so-
ciety, this stage formed basic institutes of market economy and democ-
racy and restored relative stability, both macroeconomic and political. 
By the end of the 1990s the following problems had been solved: 1) 
basic political institutions had been established, the most significant 
element of that being the adoption of the Constitution of the Russian 
Federation and regulation of federative relations; 2) macroeconomic 
stabilization had been reached by 2004 providing the country with a 
relatively steady currency and balanced budget; 3) mass privatization 
had been conducted which laid a basis for transition of the Russian 
economy to a market economy. Creation and development of private 
property institutions became one of the key factors creating a basis for 
further stable economic growth. 

The second stage started in the beginning of the 2000s. This period 
has become the time of restoration and growth of the economy. The 
federal government has gained a possibility to solve strategic tasks. 
Intensifying efforts to ensure macroeconomic and political stability the 
President and the Government of Russia have directed major attention 
at formation of economic institutes typical for a modern market and 
democratic society and corresponding to the peculiarities of Russia. 
The Civil, Taxation, Budget, Labor, Land, Forrest, and Water Codes, 
new pension and bankruptcy legislation have been adopted. Much has 
been done towards debureaucratization (deregulation) and improve-
ment of inter-budgetary relations (federal budget, regional and local 
budgets), improvement of monetary legislation, reforming of natural 
monopolies and other things [8].

At the same time, further progress in development of Russia’s 
economy including national maritime activity obviously depends on, 
first of all, successful resolution of a range of problems, common for 
the development of the country and its economy as a whole. These 
problems include progressive structure shifts in 
the economy (diversification and overcoming of 
infrastructure restrictions), building effective mar-
ket institutions and creating progressive business 
environment, improving effectiveness of govern-
ment institutions, and developing human potential. 
This progress should be achieved by relying on 
strategic competitive benefits of Russia having 
substantial marine components such as energy, 
transit, innovation, and ecologic potential. 

It should be mentioned that forming a new pro-
gressive competitive environment is especially 
important for such a traditionally conflict sphere 
as nature management, first of all multi-sectoral 
ocean management. 

Speaking of key problems of the economy’s 
maritime sector it should be mentioned that Rus-
sia still lacks economic, financial, legislative, 
and institutional basis for their solution. For the 
development of mineral and energy resources 
of the continental shelf, these problems include 
construction of new equipment, intensification 
of geologic and geophysical surveys on shelf, 
substantiation of enlargement of shelf boundaries. 
For the development of water biologic resources, 
these include reduction of a raw component in 
the Russian export of fish products and increase 
of the share of Russian producers, and significant 
reduction of the shady turnover of fish products. 
For the development of marine shipping these 
problems include growth of cargo transfer vol-
umes in Russian ports and increase in the share of 
Russian shipping companies in the whole volume 
of national foreign-trade operations. This is also 
restoration of the ship building industry, improve-
ment of economic provision of the Russian Navy, 
use of potential possibilities of the Northern Sea 
Route for the provision of stable functioning of 

the Russian Arctic Zone and transit sea shipping, intensification of 
scientific research, etc. 

Since recently definite steps have been made to solve these problems. 
These are, among others, establishment of the Joint Ship Building 
Corporation by the Federal law in 2007, adoption of the Federal Target 
Program “Development of Civil Maritime Machinery and Equipment 
(2009-2016)”, working out of the State Program for the Explora-
tion and Development of the Continental Shelf, restoration of an 
self-dependent Federal Agency of Fisheries in 2007, adoption of the 
Federal Target Program “Development of Fishery Resource Potential 
and Its Effective Use”, working out of a program for substantiation 
of the outer limits of the country’s continental shelf, renovation of the 
Federal Target Program “Modernization of Russian Transport System” 
with its marine-oriented subprogram, etc.

The specificity of integrated marine management has not yet been 
introduced into the development and execution of comprehensive pro-
grams of socio-economic development of Russia’s coastal provinces 
and coastal local communities (first of all the necessity of taking into 
account the spatial and territory aspect of the marine activity develop-
ment).

Situation in the region
Nowadays the prevailing maritime activities in the Russian Arctic are 
fisheries in the Barents Sea and cargo shipping. Oil and gas production 
and extraction of chemical, mineral and building raw material have 
been substantially increasing over the last years (Fig. 3.1)
For Russia, sea shipping is of great importance connecting territories 
with each other and playing a vital role in external economic activi-
ties. The role of sea shipping remains essential in supporting the life of 
coastal communities of the Utmost North and the Far East of Russia. 
Sea transport as one of the main components of the maritime sector is

closely and logically connected with other sectors of the economy, dis-
tribution of production and population in coastal areas, and exploita-
tion and development of mineral, biological and recreational resources 
of the sea (Fig. 3.2).

Traditionally arctic seas have been used, first of all, for coastwise 
shipping or international shipping between neighboring countries. The 
Russian Northern Sea Route has always been playing a greater role 
both by volumes of cargo shipped and by its strategic significance. 
Geographically the Northern Sea Route runs from north-western 
boundaries of Russia (ports of Murmansk and Arkhangelsk) to the Ber-
ing Strait occupying about 3 000 nautical miles. 

Northern Sea Route is a single latitudinal water artery connecting all 
the arctic and subarctic regions of Russia with their rich mineral, en-
ergy and biologic resources, and having a great influence on develop-
ment of the Russian territories located south of the Arctic Ocean for 
many hundreds of kilometers (first of all along large rivers). Exploita-
tion of the Northern Sea Route demands non-traditional approaches. 
This relates to severe nature conditions of the region, first of all ice 
cover along navigation routes and particular vulnerability of the arctic 
nature. Russia has spent great resources and efforts of many genera-
tions to explore and develop the Northern Sea Route having built the 
infrastructure, powerful ice-breaker and transport fleet, systems for 
hydrographic and hydrometeorologic support of shipping.
Volumes of cargo shipped along the Northern Sea Route reached 6.5 
mln tons in 1987. Drastic economic reforms in Russia decreased this 
index by a factor of 4. Economic stabilization in Russia should inevita-
bly result in restoration and further growth of the Northern Sea Route 
significance. The main factor of prospective increase of economic ac-
tivity in this region is the development of onshore and offshore oil and 
gas production in the Barents Sea, South-East Barents Sea (Pechora 
Sea), and Kara Sea. Potential volumes of oil and gas shipping from 
these regions are estimated at 50 mln tons a year. 
By now multiyear navigation practice has showed a possibility of all-
the-year-round navigation of large-capacity vessels along the Northern 
Sea Route using both traditional and high-latitude routes. 

The role of navigation in coastal waters (cabotage) is especially 

important for the northern and eastern coasts of 
Russia where it very often has no alternatives. 
Such territories involve the arctic zone from the 
Norwegian border to the Bering Strait including 
arctic islands and mouths of large Asian rivers, 
the Ob, the Yenisey, the Lena, and less exten-
sive the Khatanga, the Anabar, the Olenek, the 
Yana, the Indigirka, and the Kolyma. Goods 
and materials are shipped to arctic ports of Rus-
sia according to a traditional scheme, both from 
the west and from the east. Petroleum products, 
technical cargo, and food products are mainly 
transported from west to east, from ports of the 
Western Arctic sector of Russia (Murmansk 
and Archangelsk) to Asian ports located in the 
Eastern Arctic sector of Russia. Far Eastern 
ports (Vladivostok, Nakhodka, Vanino and oth-
ers) supply to the west into the Russian Arctic 
building material, technical and technological 
cargo, and food products. Transport of goods 
and materials from the Arctic is mainly oriented 
to the west. Coastal navigation plays an im-
portant role in the development of the Norilsk 
Industrial Complex, oil and gas complex of 
Western Siberia, and  extractive enterprises of 
Yakutiya and Chukotka. 

Economic crisis of the 1990s and transition of 
Russia from planned to market economy the 
most seriously affected the arctic regions which 
highly depended on centralized state govern-
ance and funding. The volume of annual ship-
ping of goods and materials along the Northern 
Sea Route decreased from 6.5 mil tons in the 
1980s to 1.5 mil tons in the end of the 1990s. 
In the Western Arctic Sector of Russia (Barents 

Sea and Kara Sea) shipping was reduced by a factor of 2.8 while in 
the Eastern Arctic Sector (from the Laptev Sea to the Chukchee Sea) 
it was reduced by a factor of 16. This happened because of collapse 
of many industrial enterprises in the Eastern Russian Arctic. At the 
same time the demand for annual marine transportation in the Western 
Russian Arctic remained owing to export-oriented industries (oil and 
gas, non-ferrous metallurgy, forestry). Turnover of goods in ports of 
the Eastern Arctic decreased in the same proportions and only the port 
of Dudinka has kept its importance as a main link between the Norilsk 
Industrial Complex and consumers of its output. The structure of trans-
portation has also changed: the share of building material, machinery 
and equipment decreased while that of petroleum products, coal, and 
food products increased.

Economic activity along the Northern Sea Route has been intensified 
over the last years. The effectiveness of icebreaker pilotage increases 
with the growth of goods turnover. The growth of demand for shipping 
along the Northern Sea Route in the nearest 5-10 years is expected to 
be induced by the need for oil transport from deposits of Siberia and 
Northwest Russia and backward transport of pipes, building materials 
and other goods, and by the development of container traffic between 
Europe and Southeast Asia. 

The latter concerns the use of the Northern Sea Route for transit 
between countries of North-Western Europe and countries of the 
Pacific Region (Japan, China, USA, Canada, etc.). As far back as the 
18th century Russian scientist Mikhail Lomonosov proposed an idea of 
using icebreakers to make the Northern Sea Route a shortest way into 
the Pacific Ocean. So the extension of the Hamburg-Yokohama route 
(11 400 nautical miles via the Suez Canal) decreases by a factor of 1.7 
via the Northern Sea Route.

Russian and foreign experts make optimistic estimates of the Northern 
Sea Route’s competitive capacity for goods transit (compared to south-
ern routes), its navigation reliability and safety. According to some 
estimates, the freight flow along the Northern Sea Route may reach 
10 mil tons a year by 2010 and 50 mil tons a year by 2020 provided 
that appropriate investments into the development of the Northern Sea 
Route’s infrastructure are made and that icebreakers and transport ves-

sels of new generation are constructed. Taking into account increased 
requirements to navigation under ice conditions and particular vulner-
ability of the Arctic nature, shipping along the Northern Sea Route 
should be executed under strict government control. This is consistent 
with the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea according to which 
countries bordering on seas ice-bound over 6 months a year have right 
to set their own rules of shipping within their jurisdiction areas. 
The most serious manifestation of the economic crisis of the 1990s is 
the depopulation of the Russian Arctic. In the 1990s, the population of 
the northern territories of Russia substantially decreased (Table 3.1). 
Especially large relative losses fell on small settlements along the coast 
resulting from a decrease in military activity and concentration of 

fisheries in few large coastal sites (Murmansk, Belomorsk, Norwegian 
ports). This tendency is expected to be reversed due to a prospective 
upturn in the economy of Northwest Russia, especially in the oil and 
gas sector.

Eurasian coast of the Russian Arctic east of Kola Peninsula is weakly 
populated. The population of harbor towns and villages along the 
Northern Sea Route is 5 000 to 10 000 people, while smaller commu-
nities number only several hundreds of people each. 

The aforementioned difference in demography and economy of coastal 
communities is well in accordance with the existing scheme of delimi-
tation of LMEs. The most productive LMEs have denser population 
and dominate in the development of the marine sector of the economy.

On the Barents Sea coast, 90 % of all population is concentrated 
around Kola Inlet. According to the population census of 2002 correct-
ed by a later assessment of the Murmansk population, the population 
of this territory nowadays is about 450 000 people including 332 000 
people in the Murmansk agglomeration (the towns of Murmansk and 
Kola), 75 000 people in the town of Severomorsk and adjacent areas, 
and 43 000 people in towns located in the northwest of Kola Inlet 
(Polyarniy, Snezhnogorsk, Skalistiy). Rural population in the area is 
insignificant (about 1 % of the total). Almost all the people inhabiting 
this territory live within 5 kilometers from the sea. Almost all the infra-
structure and enterprises are also located within this area. 

Communities situated in other territories of the Arctic coast number 
less than 10 000 people each, except Naryan-Mar which is more likely 
an inland port than a sea harbor. It should be mentioned that maritime 
economic activities on the Kola Peninsula coast outside the Kola Inlet 
territory are mainly presented by naval stations and protection of fron-
tiers. The port and industrial complex of Kola Inlet occupies a domi-
nant, and even a monopolistic, place in the civilian maritime sector. 
It includes commercial and fish sea ports, land transport junction, fish 
processing enterprises in Murmansk, naval stations in Severomorsk 
and Polyarniy, and naval and civilian shipyards in Murmansk, Roslya-
kovo, Polyarniy, and Snezhnogorsk. The coastal zone is very unevenly 
developed: industrial enterprises and housing areas and mooring lines 
alternate with areas of the coast with natural undisturbed landscapes. 

The current status and prospects of development of the port and indus-
trial complex in many respects depend on the whole socio-economic 
situation in Murmansk Oblast (province), including the situation in 
mining industry, non-ferrous metallurgy, building, and agriculture, as 
well as living standard and employment. 

The industry is presented mainly by raw sectors of economy (fishery, 
extraction and processing of minerals) and by processing industries 
(non-ferrous metallurgy, fish production, woodworking). Non-ferrous 
metallurgy occupies the largest share in the structure of industrial out-

put (28 %). The share of electric power production is 22 %, 15 % fall 
on food production (including fish processing – 13 %), again 15 % is 
the share of chemical industry (production of apatite concentrate), fer-
rous metallurgy has 12 % and the share of engineering and machinery 
construction is 5 %. The contribution of other branches is insignificant. 
Annual indices of industrial output in some branches are the follow-
ing: iron-ore concentrate – up to 10 mil tons, apatite concentrate – 3-4 
mil tons, saw-timber – about 20 000 cubical meters. Annual fish catch 
by the beginning of the 1990s reached 1 200 000 tons, then in the mid 
1990s it was reduced to 400 000-450 000 tons and in 2005 increased 
again up to 585 000 tons. However most fish caught in the Barents 
Sea (up to 75 %) is landed outside Murmansk Oblast. That’s why the 

share of fish industry in the total production of output in the region 
decreased from 31 to 13 % in 2004. The capacities of fish processing 
enterprises in 2004-2005 were used only for 15-20 % of the total. The 
recession mostly affected the production of canned fish which now 
comprises only 10 % of the level of 1990. The fishing fleet is highly 
depreciated and obsolescent. 

Since the beginning of the 2000s, a substantial increase in petroleum 
transport in Kola Inlet has been observed. Several offshore oil termi-
nals were put into production. Land-based oil terminals are located 
at the oil storage depot of the Murmansk fish port, at the “Shipyard 
35” enterprise, and at naval facilities. Offshore terminals in Kola Inlet 
transfer oil from shuttle tankers into storage vessels and then into 
large-capacity transport tankers. The largest of such terminals is the 
storage tanker “Belokamenka” with a deadweight of 360 000 tons 
located in the central bend of Kola Inlet near the village of the same 
name. The total volume of petroleum products processed at offshore 
and land-based terminals comprises now 20 mil tons and is expected to 
grow twofold by 2010-2015.

The only shipping company in the region capable of operating in the 
Arctic all the year round is the Murmansk Shipping Company (MSC). 
MSC has been traditionally specializing in arctic shipping and until 
August 2008 executed day-to-day management of the state icebreaker 
fleet. Since August 2008 the state icebreaker fleet has been transferred 
into the Atomflot Company, regulated by a different agency than MSC 
(Ministry of Energy instead of Ministry of Transport). Interactions 
between the Murmansk Shipping Company and the Atomflot Company 
will be rested upon a commercial basis.

MSC vessels transport 80 % of all goods and materials along the 
Northern Sea Route. A diverse structure of the fleet enables the MSC 
to ship the production of the “Norilsk Nikel” and the “Apatite” enter-
prises, transport coal from Svalbard, oil and petroleum products from 
the Varandey, the Kolguyev, Ob deposits, Yakutia, the White Sea, and 
Murmansk and from the Baltic Sea. The share of bulked cargo in total 
fleet operations (around 9 mil tons a year) increased from 20 to 50 % 
in 2000-2004. By 2005 the MSC controlled 12 vessels with a total 
deadweight of 290 000 tons running under the flags of convenience. 

The MSC will play an important role in revival of shipping along 
the Northern Sea Route for the development of large gas deposits, 
transport of raw material abroad, and supporting arctic communities 
of Russia. The MSC possesses the new offshore terminal at Varandey. 
According to estimates, the volume of sea shipping in the Arctic may 
reach 12 mil tons by 2010 and 50 mil tons by 2020. In the light of 
these estimates Russia starts overhauling its cargo ice-class fleet and 
icebreakers. Recently a new nuclear-powered icebreaker called “50 
Let Pobedy” (50 Years of Victory) has been commissioned into the 
icebreaker fleet. The icebreaker has replaced the decommissioned 
nuclear-powered icebreaker “Sibir” (Siberia) and, together with new

diesel electric icebreakers, is to support a stable navigation along the 
Northern Sea Route. The overhauling of the icebreaker fleet would be 
partially funded by private companies “Norilsk Nikel”, “LUKOIL” 
and some other industrial groups in a form of state-private partnership. 
LUKOIL possesses its own tanker company which fleet comprised 10 
ice-class tankers with a total deadweight of 180 000 tons in 2004. With 
the help of these tankers LUKOIL has started a year-round export of 
crude oil and gas condensate produced by the company in the Timano-
Pechora region. In 2002 the Association of the Users of the Northern 
Sea Route was created. The Association united more than 20 member-
companies.

It should be mentioned that the maritime sector in the Barents Sea is 
mainly oriented to exploitation of living resources. Other maritime 
activities either do not affect seriously the ecosystem (sea transport, 
military activities) or have just started developing and are expected 
to be intensified in the future (oil and gas production on shelf). Thus 
nowadays fishery is the main factor affecting the ecosystem, which 
though may soon be crowded by gas production from the Shtokman 
Gas Condensate Deposit being increasingly developed.

Thus, the Barents Sea plays a particular role which is determined by 
two major factors: first its special geopolitical and strategic role and 
second its rich natural resources. There is every reason to believe that 
in 2008-2015 this region will become one of the major sources of fuel 
reserves and an important factor of global energy safety. At the same 
time it’s very important to prevent the loss of the Barents Sea living 
resources because of increased oil and gas production on shelf and 
to preserve the status of this sea as one of the most important World 
Ocean’s basins as regards biological resources. Therefore the Barents 
Sea will inevitably be transformed into an integral area which implies 
special requirements to the management over this water body. 

Nowadays the whole arctic shelf is regarded as a single oil and gas 
bearing super-basin with resources equal to 83-110 billion tons which 
exceeds resources of other oceans. Numerous oil fields have been 
discovered in the Kara Sea including huge Rusanovskoye and Lenin-
gradskoye gas condensate deposits, 4.5 trillion cubical meters each, 
exceeding the well-known Shtokman deposit in the Barents Sea which 
is planned to be put on production in 2013.

Biologic resources of the Kara Sea are used nowadays only by scarce 
local population and this will hardly change in the near future. Large-
scale exploitation of living marine resources in the Kara Sea is impos-
sible due to severe ice and climate conditions, scarce resources and 
their slow reproduction, and remoteness from markets. Fishing of com-
mercial anadromous fish species here is more expedient in rivers. On 
the other hand, scarce population and lack of large industries in eastern 
Arctic regions of Russia serve as a protection against environmental 
degradation. That’s why the management of the Kara Sea and other 
arctic seas should above all be rested upon nature conservation princi-
ples according to the federal acts: the Federal Act on the Protection of 
the Environment and the Federal Act on Environmental Examination.

Natural and ethnographic peculiarities of the Arctic region condi-
tion the development of environmental, fishing and extreme kinds of 
tourism here, related to its exotic nature. The development of tourist 
business is to a great extent connected to ways of further development 
of indigenous peoples of the North. A particular importance of inter-
relation between tourism and environmental protection in the Arctic 
has been largely understood since recently. 

The concept of Linking Tourism and Conservation in the Arctic origi-
nated from the 1995 Second International Symposium on Polar Tour-
ism in St. Petersburg, Russia. Since that time, a series of workshops 
have developed Principles and Codes of Conduct for Arctic Tourism 
and a mechanism for their practical implementation. Because tourism 
in Russia differs significantly from other parts of the Arctic, a separate 
effort will be required to introduce the principles and implement the 
mechanism there. The challenge will be to adapt lessons learned else-
where for conditions in Russia — the largest and least disturbed parts 
of the circumpolar Arctic.

During the last years, Russian icebreakers have been making constant 
tourist voyages to the North Pole, the Franz Josef Land Archipelago, 

or from Provideniye (Providence) Bay (Bering Strait) along the 
Northern Sea Route with tourists from the USA, Japan, Canada and 
other countries on board. Major conditions for the development of this 
kind of tourism is a construction of a special fleet and coastal tourist 
infrastructure.

Speaking of participation of indigenous arctic peoples in management 
of the region’s development one should mention that despite uniting 
organizations (including the Association of Indigenous Peoples of the 
North), indigenous peoples have very little influence on the decision-
making process. 

Fishery
The fish fauna of the Barents Sea includes about 150 fish species. One 
third of them are boreal species that rarely enter the Barents Sea from 
the west. Ninety to ninety-five species permanently live in the Barents 
Sea. Less than 30 species are of commercial value. Commercially 
important fisheries are for cod, haddock, saithe, capelin, polar cod, 
herring (2 species), red fish (2 species), wolffishes (3 species) and 
some other species. Most part of commercial fisheries falls under the 
jurisdiction of two and more countries therefore they are regulated by 
bilateral and multilateral agreements including the Joint Norwegian-
Russian Fisheries Commission. These are fisheries for cod, haddock, 
Atlantic Scandinavian herring, capelin, red fish, black halibut, blue 
whiting, Atlantic mackerel, and partly saithe. 

Commercial fishery serves as an index of the LME productivity and 
resources potential but simultaneously it imposes on a LME a potential 
risk of anthropogenic degradation due to over-fishing. Thus, annual 
catch in the Barents Sea has decreased 3 to 4 times during the second 
half of the 20th century. Dramatic changes in abundance of the most 
important commercial fish stocks, cod and capelin, have been regis-
tered.

The economically and politically dominant fishery in the Barents Sea 
is for Northeast Arctic cod. The Barents Sea fishery for cod depends 
on the state of its stock. Thus, if for the period of 1955-1979 the total 
annual catch averaged about 445 000 tons at fluctuations within the 
range of 202 000 to 841 000 tons, then when the cod stock was the 
most greatly depressed (1983-1984) the total annual catch decreased to 
56 000-58 000 tons. Over the last seven years (2000-2006) the Russian 
cod quota varied within the range of 181 400 to 212 600 tons.

Among major problems that the Barents Sea fisheries for cod and had-
dock face nowadays poaching is one of the most important. According 
to Norwegian estimates, annual overfishing of cod over the period of 
2002-2005 constituted 80 000 to 120 000 tons and 101 000 tons in 
2005. According to Russian estimates this was less than 26 000 tons. 

The current status of the cod stock (between 2005 and 2008), ac-
cording to N.M. Knipovich Polar Research Institute of Fisheries and 
Oceanography (PINRO) data, is stable now and hardly will experience 
significant changes in the near future provided that Russia and Norway 
adhere to conservancy principles. At the same time inter-annual 
variations of the stock are inevitable due to natural fluctuations in 
numbers of generations entering the commercial stock. That was 
exactly the reason of that the Russian cod quota for 2007 was reduced 
to 179 500 tons. 

A clear notion of the Barents Sea fisheries could be obtained with the 
help of maps showing registered vessels operations in the fishery for 
cod, which is the dominant commercial species in the Barents Sea. 
Undertaking long migrations (feeding and pre-spawning) the cod 
spreads during the year over vast areas of the sea forming gatherings 
of commercial value, which in most cases juxtapose with other com-
mercial fish stocks. 

Figure 3.3 demonstrates fisheries operations of fishing vessels in the 
Russian EEZ and in the disputable Russian-Norwegian area (Grey 
Zone) during 2006. Besides the cod fishery, vessels fishing for had-
dock and polar cod were also taken into account. Areas of the greatest 
fishing activity are marked by a darker color. As the figure shows in 
some areas fisheries operations lasted the whole year round.

The most important fishing areas in the Russian EEZ are the Rybachya 
Bank, the North-Eastern Slope of the Murmansk Bank, the Western 
Coastal Area, and slopes of the Gusinaya (Goose) Bank. In the Grey 
Zone these are the West-Eastern Slope of the Murmansk Bank, the 
Finnmarken Bank, and the Demidov Bank. 

Transition of Russia to the market economy and partial demilitariza-
tion of Barents Sea coastal areas created conditions for development 
of coastal fishery on a new market basis. Nowadays the coastal fleet 
consists of about 160 vessels.

In 2005 and 2006 coastal quotas for bottom-dwelling species in the 
Barents Sea were at the level of 30 000 tons. Nowadays maximum uti-
lization of coastal quotas for bottom-dwelling species is possible only 
when three types of fishing are used: trawl fishing, long-line fishing, 
and hook-and-line fishing. Taking into account peculiarities of distri-
bution of bottom-dwelling stocks in Russian territorial waters, and the 
presence of the area west of the longitude 35° E banned for trawling, 
and poorly developed coastal infrastructure of Kola Peninsula, quotas 
allotted for coastal fisheries are most likely to be utilized in the follow-
ing proportion: 70 % by trawlers, 20 % by long-line fishing vessels, 
and 10 % by vessels equipped with hook-and-line or jig gear. 

When organizing coastal fisheries by the existing fleet under condi-
tions of northern seas one should take into account certain restric-
tions. Fisheries in the coastal zone of the Barents Sea due to severe 
hydrometeorologic conditions, especially during the winter period, are 
limited to 7 months. One should also take into account the seasonality 
in the formation of commercial gatherings of different stocks within 
the coastal 12-mile zone, which is also makes these fisheries season-
ally restricted. 

Formerly costal fishery in Russia was referred to as the fishery within 
internal waters and the territorial sea of the Russian Federation. 
Division of fisheries into the costal fishery and sea fishery within the 
national exclusive economic zone along the line of the territorial sea 
(a 12-mile zone) created difficulties for fishing firms due to mobility 
of fish stocks. That is why the purpose of this fishery was specified – 
supplying fish for selling and processing in the territory of the Russian 
Federation. Such a fishery involves individual entrepreneurs and com-
panies. Types of fishing vessels and fishing gear and methods of fish-
ing are determined for each fishing area. Quotas for coastal fisheries 
on shelf and in the Russian EEZ, as well as in areas under jurisdiction 
of international agreements, are allotted by the Government of Russia. 
Quotas for fisheries in internal marine waters and the territorial sea 
are allocated between users by the Federal Agency of Fisheries of the 
Russian Federation on requests from regional governments. Quotas for 
the coastal fishery are allotted to a user only provided that fish caught 
is landed in the territory of Russia.

Coastal fishery contributes to the development of coastal and port 
infrastructure of the fisheries sector, social development of coastal 
communities, provides new jobs, increases revenues into budgets of 
different levels. Fishing and fish processing companies bear large 
social responsibility providing jobs for local population and supporting 
housing and communal infrastructure of local communities.

Fishery for marine biological resources is a traditional occupation for 
a number of indigenous peoples living in the Arctic. But only fisheries 
within the Barents Sea basin have national and international signifi-
cance in the Arctic. There are still contradictions between Russian and 
Norwegian fisheries rules, especially within the Svalbard fisheries area, 
for example trawl mesh sizes, minimum size of the fish caught and 
others. Agreements on these normative differences can be successfully 

achieved within gradual Russian-Norwegian 
negotiations. Existing economic contradic-
tions between the sea fisheries and coastal 
fisheries in Russia still remain unresolved. 

Management of biological resources in 
the Barents Sea is executed on the basis 
of the 1975 Inter-government Agreement 
on Cooperation on Fisheries between the 
former USSR and Norway. This agreement 
is executed through decisions of the Joint 
Norwegian-Russian Fisheries Commission. 
The main instrument of fisheries regulation 
is the allocation of annual TACs for each 
stock. This measure is based on estimates 
of commercial stocks conducted by scien-
tists of the two countries within joint and 
national research programs. Besides, the Joint 
Norwegian-Russian Fisheries Commission 
uses such important instruments as introduc-
tion of a strictly limited catch for many fisher-
ies by allocating national quotas, introduction 
of a minimum fish size for some fisheries, and 
a range of scientifically-induced restrictions 
for use of this or that fishing gear (territorial 
bans, mesh sizes, etc).

An important role in conservation of stocks 
and sustainable management of marine fish 
resources is still played by such international 
organizations as the International Council 
on Exploration of the Sea and some other. 
Despite that their decisions are of advice 
character, coastal states try to comply with 
them.

Nowadays there is need to introduce new 
methods of fisheries management, such as 
precautionary approach for TAC allocation, 
balance ecosystem-based fisheries, etc. Under 
conditions of decreased stocks, inconsistency 
of adherence to single-species cod fisher-
ies becomes obvious. Over the last years 
the shrimp fishery has been increased in the

region first of all by Norway. Russia and Norway started commercial 
fishery for the red king crab acclimatized in the Barents Sea. At the 
same time Russian and Norwegian approaches to the red king crab 
fishery differ. Russia sets quotas for its red king crab fisheries while 
Norway does not. This depends on attitudes of both countries to this 
introduced species. Norway tries to overfish it following the provisions 
of the Convention on Conservation of Biodiversity. Russia considers 
the red king crab a valuable commercial resource which exploitation 
should be regulated without undermining the ability of the population 
to reproduce itself.

Development of fisheries in the region in the following years will be 
characterized by: a) fluctuations of stocks of the most common com-
mercial species due to climate change; b) regulation of fisheries in high 
seas and introduction of international control of fisheries; c) increased 
development of aquaculture and fish farms in coastal zones and in 
EEZs.

Development of offshore oil and gas production will be a serious 
challenge to Barents Sea fisheries. In view of vulnerability of marine 
ecosystems, there is a need for a new nature conservation strategy 
based on assessment of contaminant impacts on the primary produc-
tion, vital functions of marine living organisms, and commercial stocks 
and their reproduction capability. Special attention should be paid to 
development of the EIA procedure for oil and gas projects.

Future offshore oil and gas production activities may cause certain 
damage to marine fisheries. To compensate this damage there is a need 
to reproduce commercially valuable fish species and enlarge the net-
work of marine protected zones. The volume of these measures should 
correlate with the scale of development of oil and gas production in the 
Russian economic zone.

4. Administrative division and legislation established
According to the Constitution adopted in December 1993, the Russian 
state (Russian Federation, or Russia) consists of subjects of federation 
recognized as equal in rights in mutual relations with federal govern-
ment agencies, and independent in issues of their own competence. 
Nowadays there is a clear tendency towards integration of federal sub-
jects when subjects having small population merge with larger ones. 
At present the Russian Federation consists of 83 subjects, 21 of which 
have direct access to the sea.

In 2000 the Decree of the President of the Russian Federation intro-
duced the division of the country into seven federal districts in which 
presidential plenipotentiaries provide constitutional powers of the head 
of the state in the territory of the appropriate district. Each federal 
district includes a group of subjects of federation. Out of seven federal 
districts, five have access to sea, with three of them basically consist-
ing of coastal subjects of federation, which play a leading role.

The new internal state structure of the Russian Federation is character-
ized by a high degree of independence of the subjects of federation. At 
the same time, some current coastal subjects of federation (autono-
mous districts on the north and northeast coasts of the country) do not 
appear to be ready to assume their status and executive duties of state 
functions because, before the Constitution of 1993 was adopted, they 
had been components of larger administrative-territorial units. Clause 
2 of article 11 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation gives 
subjects of federation the right to form bodies of state power. Article 
77 of the Constitution says that the system of bodies of state power 
of subjects of federation is established independently, including the 
provision that federal executive authorities and executive authorities of 
subjects of federation form a unified system of executive power.

These changes to the state system do not provide for unified imple-
mentation of the specific issues connected to management of the ma-
rine activity, which are referred to in the competences of the Russian 
Federation in its subjects of federation. In addition to the new federal 
structure, municipal governments were introduced throughout the Rus-
sian Federation. At the same time, article 12 of the Constitution of the 
Russian Federation says, “institutions of municipal government are not 
included into the system of state power”.

Article 8 of the Russian Constitution and federal legislation have 
established high levels of independence for municipal government in-
stitutions and provided them with a large number of rights and duties. 
Formation of municipal governments on this new basis has changed 
relations between the authorities of coastal subjects of federation and 
authorities of the coastal municipalities. These relations have not been 
fully defined. Regarding finances, the dependence of local govern-
ments on regional institutions, and through them on federal executive 
authorities, has not only been maintained but conditions of economic 
recession frequently exacerbated it. At the same time, there is no 
clear definition of the new order and rules of participation for coastal 
local government institutions in implementing maritime activity and 
national marine policy. As a result, in the Russian Federation there is 
a governing system based on three authority levels – federal, regional, 
and local. The relationship between these levels concerning marine 
activity problems in many respects remains uncertain. 

Currently, according to Russian legislation, the legal status of sea 
expanses is established on a new approach basis. Clause 1 of article 
67 of the Constitution of the Russian Federation states that the terri-
tory of the Russian Federation includes the territories of its subjects, 
internal waters, and the territorial sea and air space above them. This 
implies that internal maritime waters and the territorial sea are not part 
of territories of subjects of the Russian Federation. Clause 2 of article 
67 says: “The Russian Federation has sovereign rights and carries out 
jurisdiction over the continental shelf and in the exclusive economic 
zone of the Russian Federation in the order determined by the federal 
law and international law regulations” (not by regional laws). Simul-
taneously, according to clause “m” of article 71 of the Constitution of 
the Russian Federation, the definition of the status of the territorial sea, 
EEZ and the continental shelf is also referred to the exclusive compe-
tence of the Russian Federation. These positions make it difficult to 
actively engage subjects of federation in implementing national marine 
policy and developing marine activity [8].

In the field of joint competence of the Russian Federation and its 
subjects there is no direct mention concerning marine matters either. 
It is necessary to note that clause “c” of article 72 of the Constitution 
of the Russian Federation specifies that “water resources” are a joint 
competence of the Russian Federation and its subjects. However, in-
ternal maritime waters and the territorial sea are declared in the Water 
Code of the Russian Federation to be federal property (article 8). At 
the same time, the operational regulation specifies in article 26 of the 
Water Code that management of the federal property on water bodies 
is to be carried out by the Government of the Russian Federation. Part 
of responsibilities for the management of federal property on water 
bodies, according to the Constitution of the Russian Federation and 
the Water Code, can be transferred by the Government of the Russian 
Federation to interested federal executive agencies and executive agen-
cies of subjects of the federation. Under current legislation, subjects 
of the Russian Federation do not have regulating power in the sphere 
of marine activity, although they can (in some cases) participate in 
management of water bodies. 

As already noted, definition of the status of the internal maritime 
waters, the territorial sea and the continental shelf according to the 
Constitution of the Russian Federation, is referred to the exclusive 
competence of the Russian Federation. The status of the specified sea 
expanses is determined in accordance with the international law and 
regulated by federal acts “On the Continental Shelf of the Russian 
Federation” (1995), “On the Internal Maritime Waters, Territorial Sea 
and Contiguous Zone of the Russian Federation” (1998), and “On the 
Exclusive Economic Zone of the Russian Federation” (1998). The 
establishment of such a detailed legal regime by means of federal laws 
and other legislative acts does not mean, however, exclude participa-
tion by coastal subjects of the Russian Federation in implementing of 
federal power on preservation, and use and management of marine 
resources and expanses. According to the Constitution, federal execu-
tive authorities have the right to establish such regimes for those sea 
expanses that provide an optimum level of competences of coastal 
subjects of the Russian Federation in the designated area. However, in 
the enacting legislation, these opportunities have not been realized [8].

Thus, changes to the internal administrative and territorial division 
at all levels are of an extremely deep and qualitative character. The

system of state power and management already has been created. It is 
provided with several legal regulatory acts, however, the process of 
reform is not complete. The changed state system, system of author-
ity and management, as well as a multitude of conceptual documents, 
legislative and statutory acts, are not cohesive and require additional 
work. The reform of administrative-territorial division of the Russian 
Federation requires preparatory and implementation efforts. 

Marine Doctrine
The Marine Doctrine of the Russian Federation for the period to 2020 
[10], authorized by the President of the Russian Federation (27 July 
2001), reveals the essence, content and method of implementing a 
national marine policy (Fig. 4.1) which is a major component of state 
policy of the Russian Federation. The Doctrine sets out a set of  
concepts necessary for resolving practical tasks in the World Ocean  
(Fig. 4.2). Russian national marine policy is carried out under two 
broad categories:
	Functional: examining types of marine activity (transport, fishing,  
 naval, etc.) depending on Russia’s economic opportunities and the  
 role of Russia in international relations;

	Regional: taking into account Russia’s position on the globe, as  

 well as geographical and other features of its regions.

The Marine Doctrine of the Russian Federation provides criteria for 
evaluation of the national marine policy: an opportunity to implement 
the national marine policy’s short-term and long-term tasks; a degree 
of realization of sovereign rights in the EEZ, over the continental shelf, 
and also high seas freedoms for merchant, fishing, research and other 
Russian specialized fleets; the ability of Russian maritime military 
component to protect territory from marine threats and state interests 
in the World Ocean.

Russia determined its national interests in the World Ocean and 
declared them in the Marine Doctrine. According to this document, the 
national interests of the Russian Federation in the World Ocean are:

	inviolability of Russia’s sovereignty beyond its land territory to its  
 internal maritime waters, the territorial sea, as well as to the air  
 space over them, to the seabed and subsoil;

	safeguarding sovereign rights and jurisdiction of the Russian 
 Federation in the EEZ and over the continental shelf, i.e., 
 exploration, exploitation and conservation of natural resources  
 (both living and non-living resources located on the seabed,   

in its subsoil and the waters superja- 
cent to the seabed), as well as manage 
ment of these resources; generation 
of energy from water, currents and   
winds; creation and use of artificial  
islands, construction and structures;
marine scientific research; and protec- 
tion and conservation of the marine 
environment;

	realization of the high seas freedoms  
 in the interest of the Russian   
 Federation including freedom of  
 navigation, overflight, to laying  
 submarine cables and pipelines,  
 fishing and scientific research;

	protection of human life at the sea,  
 prevention of marine environmental  
 pollution, maintenance of the control  
 over vital sea communications,   
 creation of the conditions promoting  
 benefits from marine economic  
 activities to the population of the  
 Russian Federation, especially its  
 coastal regions, and also to the state as  
 a whole.

Thus, the purposes of the national marine 
policy of the Russian Federation are 
ensuring and protecting state sovereignty, 
sovereign rights, and freedoms of the high 
seas in the World Ocean. 

The Marine Doctrine of the Russian Fed-
eration stipulates that subjects of national 
marine policy are the state and society. 
The state implements national marine 
policy through the bodies of state power of 
the Russian Federation and the subjects of 
the Russian Federation. Society partici-
pates in the formation and implementa-
tion of national marine policy through 
federal and regional representative bodies, 
institutions of local government and public 
associations working under the jurisdiction 
of the Constitution and the legislation of 
the Russian Federation.

The following are the basic activities of 
the national marine policy actors:
	comprehensive identification of priori 
 ties of the national marine policy on  
 near and long-term prospects;

 continuous upgrading of the contents of national marine activity;
	management of the components of the  state marine potential,  
 branches of the economy and science related to maritime activity;
	creation of a favorable legal regime;
	economic, information, scientific, personnel another   
 ensuring the national marine policy;
	evaluation of the efficiency of national marine policy and its 
 subsequent updating.

The subjects of the national marine policy are 
guided by the principles of national marine policy 
formulated in the Marine Doctrine. These princi-
ples are common for both functional and regional 
category of national marine policy (Fig. 4.3).

The Marine Doctrine also implies coordination 
of efforts of the federal government and regional 
governments in defining priority objections and 
substance of the national maritime policy for short-
term and long-range outlook, and in management 
of the constituents of the maritime potential of 
Russia, economy and science branches connected 
with maritime economic activities, and in planning 
of maritime economic activities and construction of 
the Russian fleet.

5. Institutions and Policy
The prerogative of defining priority objections 

and the substance of the national maritime policy 
belongs to the President of the Russian Federation. 
Besides, the President, according to the Constitution, 
undertakes measures to secure the sovereignty of the 
Russian Federation in the World Ocean, to protect 
and secure the interests of a person, society and the 
state in the field of maritime affairs. The President 
also provides guidance of the national oceans policy. 
The Security Council of the Russian Federation as a 
constitutional body attached to the President of the 
Russian Federation reveals threats, determines vi-
tally important demands of the society and the state, 
and works out major directions of the safety strategy 
of Russia in the World Ocean.

Issues of national marine policy can be also con-
sidered at the sessions of the State Council of the 
Russian Federation, a deliberative body headed by 
the President of the Russian Federation that was 
created according to Presidential decree. It aims to 
sustain and use the potential of the regional supreme 
officials. Issues of marine activity are also super-
vised by the President’s plenipotentiaries in federal 
districts of the Russian Federation, who can present 
their proposals in the field of marine policy.

The system of long-term decision-making along 
with the legislative and normative base together 
ensure that a sound state marine policy has been de-
veloped in the Russian Federation and that it contin-
ues to be improved. Its conceptual bases have been 
developed according to the 1982 UN Convention on 
the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which Russia rati-
fied in 1997 as part of the Russian Federation’s par-
ticipation in activity of other international maritime 
institutions, treaties, and agreements and assumes 
appropriate national legislation development.

The Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation 
(the Parliament) within the frames of its constitu-
tional authority does legislative business to ensure 
the execution of the national marine policy. For 
these purposes to be achieved, the Commission on 
the National Ocean Policy was established in 2004 
within the Federation Council (the upper chamber of 

the Parliament). The main tasks of the Commission are the following: 
monitoring of legislation in the filed of the maritime affairs, elabora-
tion of proposals for projects of federal acts for the Federation Council 
aimed at increasing the effectiveness of maritime economic activities, 
interaction with federal bodies of the executive power involved in 
maritime affairs. 
Draft laws go to the State Duma where they are examined by ap-
propriate committees and commissions, or are elaborated on by them. 
Afterwards draft laws have to be affirmed at plenary sessions. Draft

laws accepted by the State Duma go on for approval to the Council 
of Federation. In cases of disagreement, conciliation commissions are 
created. When a draft law is approved in the upper chamber of parlia-
ment, it goes to the President of the Russian Federation for signature. 
The Marine Doctrine lays out the basis of the national marine policy. 

At the same time, a system of basic documents outlining the contents 
of Russia’s marine policy has been developed (Table 5.1), which is 
however being constantly improved.

Provisions stipulated by federal laws and other directive documents

are formalized by the normative legal acts developed and accepted by 
the Government of the Russian Federation, as well as the appropriate 
federal executive authorities.

Nowadays the oceans management in Russia involves around 10 fed-
eral ministries and agencies as well as regional governments of coastal 
regions (Figure 5.1). The exploitation of marine living resources is 
regulated by the Federal Agency of Fisheries. Navigation in the Arctic 
is regulated by the Ministry of Transport. The Ministry of Natural 
Resources and Ecology regulates prospecting and exploration and the 
Ministry of Energy - extraction of mineral resources on shelf and in 
coastal areas. Protection of marine environment and ecosystems is 
regulated by the Federal Nature Management Surveillance Service 
which is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Natural Resources 
and Ecology.

Marine Board
The Marine Board of the Government of the Russian Federation, 
headed by the Deputy Chairman of the Government of the Russian 
Federation (the Deputy Prime Minister), is a permanent coordinating 
body, which brings together the actions of federal executive agencies, 
regional executive agencies and the organizations engaged in marine 
activity of the Russian Federation, for the purpose of implementing 
Russia’s marine policy. The Marine Board has become the main body 
responsible for formulation of short-term and current tasks (Fig. 5.2).

The Marine Board members are heads of federal executive agencies, 
regional executive agencies, scientific and other organizations that 
study, develop and use the World Ocean. The membership of the Ma-
rine Board is approved by the Government of the Russian Federation. 
Representatives of interested government bodies, federal executive 
agencies, regional executive authorities, state institutions, as well as 
scientists and experts on marine matters mentioned above take part in 
Marine Board sessions. With the Marine Board chairman’s approval, 
representatives from NGOs, commercial entities and mass media can 
be invited to the Board’s sessions. Marine Board activity was initially 
focused on the creation of conditions for decisions by the Russian 
Government, federal and regional executive authorities on tasks of 
protection and realization of sovereign rights and meeting obligations 
to the world community accepted by the Russian Federation in internal 
maritime waters, the territorial sea, the EEZ, over the continental shelf, 
the high seas, in Arctic and Antarctic regions, as well as on increased 
maritime activity efficiency and maintaining military-political stability, 
national security and neutralize maritime threats and strengthening the 
international authority of the Russian Federation.

The experience gained suggests that this coordination body is the 
major practical guide to marine activity in the Russian Federation. It 
carries out preparatory and scientific, political and economic recom-
mendations for adjusting and implementing the marine policy of the 
state. The Marine Board has intensified its work over the last years. 
Its structure has been improved and new bodies have been established 
within the Board including interagency commissions, the Secretariat, 
the Science and Advisory Panel.

The aim of establishing interagency commissions was to intensify the 
work of the Marine Board and to form workable bodies within the 
ministries. That was hard work but now the process has been almost 
completed. At present the Marine Board includes several interagency 
commissions: Commission on the National Maritime Policy and the 
Execution of the Federal Program “World Ocean”; Sea and Inland 
Water Transport Commission; Commission on Exploitation of Marine 
Biological Resources; Commission on Exploitation of Marine Mineral 
and Energy Resources; Commission on Scientific Study of the World 
Ocean; Naval Commission; Commission on the International Maritime 
Law; Shipbuilding Commission; Diving Commission; Commission on 
Information and Technical Support of Maritime Affairs.

Over the last few years the Marine Board has managed to resolve one 
of the major problems – to establish connections with federal districts 
and federal governments of the Russian Federation. Such connections 
are exercised through special coordinating advisory bodies – regional 
maritime councils. In the Russian Arctic these are Government Mari-
time Council of Murmansk Oblast, Government Maritime Council of 

Arkhangelsk Oblast, President’s Maritime Council of the Republic of 
Karelia, Government Maritime Council of Yamal-Nenets Autonomous 
Okrug, President’s Maritime Council of the Republic of Sakha (Yaku-
tia), and Government Maritime Council of Chukchee Autonomous 
Okrug.

Interactions with regional maritime councils, which include represent-
atives of local governments (local coastal communities), allow taking 
into account demands and peculiarities of coastal regions. Initiatives of 
these regional councils would contribute to solution of burning socio-
economic problems of coastal communities.

Advisory bodies on marine activity have been established in Moscow 
and in two federal districts. Interactions with these advisory bodies 
will allow executing Russia’s ocean policy more efficiently.

Thus, established for the first time in Russia, the effective mechanism 
of coordination of actions of all the actors involved in maritime affairs 
integrates efforts of these actors in execution of provisions of the 
Marine Doctrine at all major directions of work of the Government of 
Russia. This mechanism is aimed at making prospective strategic deci-
sions of Russia on exploration of resources and expanses of the World 
Ocean for national purposes.

World Ocean Program
The necessity of overcoming the negative consequences of maritime 
economic liberalization and uncontrolled privatization of the maritime 
economy basic production assets was evident in the mid-1990s. It was 
clear that Russia’s participation in developing resources and expanses 
of the World Ocean was closely connected to improving manage-
ment, including state regulation, together with purposeful scientific 
and technical development of marine activity in the country. For these 
purposes, Russia launched the federal target program (FTP) “World 
Ocean”, approved by the Act of the Government of the Russian Fed-
eration of 10 August 1998, No 919. The concept of the program was 
approved by the Decree of the President of the Russian Federation in 
January 1997. Over forty federal and provincial executive agencies 
and a dozen of research organizations took part in the development of 
this program. 

Adoption of the World Ocean Program at the nation-wide level was 
aimed at changing the existing narrowly-focused sectoral and local-
provincial approaches to conducting marine activity that were realized 
through several dozens of state programs with branch or regional ori-
entation. Since 1998, the World Ocean Program has become the basis 
of a nation-wide system of regulation and management of Russia’s 
marine activity aimed at its integration and increased effectiveness (for 
more details, see [8]).

Unfortunately from the very beginning the World Ocean Program did 
not cover all the problems of maritime affairs listed in its conception 
which was approved by the President’s decree. Moreover, the Program 
skipped complicated and the most critical problems of the regional 
development. The program does not reflect the problems of develop-
ment of external economic and scientific links with foreign countries 
and personnel training. However, in 2007 on request from the Federal 
Agency of Science and Innovation, Murmansk Marine Biological 
Institute carried out a project called “Developing integrated methods 
of oceans and coastal zone management in arctic and southern seas of 
Russia”, which testifies a slow increase of attention to this problem in 
the Government of Russia. 

Scantiness of financial recources, week involvement of subjects of 
Federation in program implementation, underestimation of the impor-
tance of integrated approaches to the problems solution have resulted 
in stopping the realization of half of the subprograms (6 of 12) which 
Federal Target Program World Ocean consisted of, and the program 
has lost its leading and coordinating role in marine activity develop-
ment, solving some important, but individual tasks. On the other hand, 
its Arctic Subprogram has received new, financial and content, impulse 
since 2008, aimed at the business activity and infrastructure develop-
ment, as well as coordination in the Arctic.

Integrated approaches to marine management
Integrated approaches to marine management have been developing 
for the last 25 years. These are the Integrated Coastal and Oceans 
Management (ICOM) and the Ecosystem Based Ocean Management 
(EBOM) appeared later. The two approaches are closely connected 
with each other since the ICOM cannot be effective without identifica-
tion of ecosystems as a whole including the human factor while the 
EBOM obviously implies an integrated approach to the ecosystems 
identified.

The EBOM approach continues developing and is widely recognized 
throughout the world as a concept used in global, national, and re-
gional research, management (first of all in fisheries), and nature con-
servation programs and documents. However, compared to the ICOM 
approach, it yet has not been widely introduced into a real practice of 
the coastal management since it still lacks carefully worked out instru-
ments for dealing with inter-sectoral problems and an institutional 
potential to be realized in practice. The last Global Conference on 
Oceans, Coasts and Islands (Hanoi, 2008) comprehensively considered 
both approaches and recommended to incorporate ICOM into EBOM 
and vice versa [13]. 

Adaptation and introduction of modern management practices (ICZM 
methodology) into the coastal and marine management in Russia 
started in the mid 1990s. At the federal level that was done through 
federal marine research programs and then since 2000 through the 
Federal Target Program World Ocean (with the Ministry of Economic 
Development of the Russian Federation as a state customer and coor-
dinator). At the regional level that was mainly initiated by international 
projects and programs (e.g. the Black Sea and the Caspian Environ-
mental programs).

Over the last years the following have been done [7, 14-16, and some 
others]:

	assessments of Russia’s coastal resource potential and situation in  
 its use;

	study of international experience in development and realization of  
 national and local ICZM programs;

	a series of conceptual and methodological papers on the ICZM has  
 been worked out and published;

	the ICZM curriculum has been drawn up and teaching students  
 ICZM in the national higher school system has started;

	an article-by-article structure of several versions of federal draft law  
 on ICZM has been worked out;

	first steps towards introducing ICZM principles and approaches into  
 the process of elaboration of local programs for coastal develop- 
 ment and use of coastal resources have been made by means  
 of coordination of efforts of federal and international projects.

Working out requirements to the development of the ICZM system 
of the Murmansk Province and its initialization for Kandalaksha Bay 
(White Sea) at the local government level are the most successful ex-
amples made to introduce ICZM approaches on-the-ground in the Rus-
sian Arctic. The steps that have already been done for the latter include 
the elaboration of the Strategic Kandalaksha Bay ICZM Development 
Plan, substantiation of organization structure of an ICZM system for 
the local level, formulation of an action plan to develop a coastal zone 
management system at the local level [17].

Success and problems in the ICZM development in Russia raised 
understanding of the necessity to arrange a meeting that could gather 
together all the specialists involved with an aim of exchanging experi-
ence, consolidating efforts, discussing problems with leading foreign 
experts, and attracting attention, first of all of managers, to the impor-
tance of improving this sphere. In view of this, the first and yet the 
only specialized international conference on ICZM “Integrated Coastal 
Zone Management and its Integration with Marine Sciences” (130 
participants from 20 countries) was held in 2000 in St. Petersburg. 

In the course of detailed discussion of issues relating to the develop-
ment and scientific support of the ICZM in countries with transition 

economies, the Conference confirmed the importance of efforts in 
this direction. It also helped identify problems hampering the ICZM 
development in these countries, work out recommendations for further 
actions including those at the international level, emphasize a special 
importance of administrative, economic and scientific circles of these 
countries being familiar with global practice of the development and 
execution of ICZM approaches and programs and the role of marine 
sciences in this.

During the last years ICZM problems in Russia are discussed at the 
special section of annual fora of strategic planning leaders held in 
Saint Petersburg by the International Centre for Social and Economic 
Research – Leontief Centre.

6. Towards ecosystem-based oceans management: 
disadvantages, challenges and future outlook
Summing up some general results of the ocean and coastal man-
agement in Russia it is important to mention the following: a) real 
introduction of ICZM approaches is a very hard task and will take 
many years, b) the essence of these approaches and instruments used 
by this methodology must be really understood, c) it is important that 
introduction of ICZM methods into management practices would be 
executed both downwards (from the federal level) and upwards (from 
the local level) with the unity of approaches used; d) the process of im-
plementation must include all the ICZM instruments and procedures.

Despite that the ICZM realization in Russia was implied by the World 
Ocean Program Concept adopted by the Russian Federation Presi-
dent’s Decree, these approaches still have not been adopted or remain 
unknown in administrative circles at all levels and other potentially 
concerned entities (e.g., business, local population, NGOs) which par-
ticipation in the decision-making process is of critical importance. This 
is an objective proof of the fact that Russia, rapidly entered market 
economy, does not pay sufficient attention to assimilation of the mod-
ern managerial practice that has proved its efficiency in marine natural 
resource use. At the same time, the thesis on necessity for ICZM 
development and realization at a state level is especially topical in the 
country, since, on the one hand, the institutional and legal tools that 
have not existed before should be built anew, and on the other hand, 
there widely remain traditional expectations and habits of relying on 
the decisive role of the State.

Despite the existence of “points of growth” along the country’s coasts 
(north, south, west, east) it is still hard for ICZM “to make its way” in 
real life in a market economy still being shaped. Subjective factor still 
plays a substantial role and application of the sustainable develop-
ment approaches to the country’s coasts still depends, first, on social 
responsibility and motivation of key executives on provincial and local 
levels, That is a direct consequence of a present level of economy and 
democracy development in Russia [7].

Present legislative and regulative basis in the maritime activity can 
also hardly contribute to development of modern ocean and coastal 
management technologies [18]:

1) Thus, in modern conceptual documents devoted to political and  
socio-economic development of democracies with market economy it 
is common, including in Russia, to identify three key acting subjects: 
state, society and business. Unfortunately, Russia’s Marine Doctrine 
recognizes only state and society as subjects of the national marine 
policy excluding business with all consequences that it implies, which 
is of course does not meet the reality. Such an approach was presented 
also at the first discussion of the Draft Russia’s Maritime Activity 
Development Strategy for the period until 2020 and further on.

2) For a range of objective and subjective reasons, the priority in 
the text of the Marine Doctrine was given to issues relating to the 
provision of national security of Russia (protection, preservation 
and ensuring of the sovereignty and sovereign rights of Russia in the 
World Ocean). In four paragraphs of the Doctrine describing Russia’s 
national interests in the World Ocean, questions of maritime economic 
activity are mentioned only at the very end of the last fourth paragraph 
after the questions of control of communication functioning, preven-
tion of marine environment contamination, and protection of man’s life

at sea. The same way of formulation was chosen for major purposes of 
the national ocean policy as well. 

The documents of such kind as the Marine Doctrine defining general 
ways of development of maritime activity, complex by nature, should 
clearly pronounce the priority of development of the economy and im-
provement of the quality of life. The Marine Doctrine should formulate 
a new, comprehensive and coordinated national marine policy, aimed 
at sound management of marine and coastal resources, development of 
maritime economy, stimulation of investments into maritime branches, 
protection of life and property, prevention of contamination, protection 
of marine environment, development of knowledge on environment, 
close cooperation of authorities and business for successful develop-
ment of marine and coastal activities of Russia.

3) It is believed that the codification of norms of the Russian marine 
legislation could contribute to creation of internally consistent and 
integral maritime activity’s legislative basis corresponding to modern 
state of country’s economy as well as the best foreign experience, and 
to performance of measures to divide functions of state regulation and 
economic management of maritime activities. The following key pro-
visions increasing effectiveness of Russia’s maritime activities would 
be optimal to introduce into federal law:

	Application of integrated approach to planning and managing the   
 maritime activity;

Nowadays Russia’s maritime activity is regulated on the basis of a 
departmental (sectoral) approach and the use of different resources 
is regulated by different legislative acts. Such a management system 
entails numerous conflicts of interests between maritime economic 
activities, does not contain mechanisms to resolve them and is poorly 
environmentally-oriented.

	Mechanism for participation of subjects of Federation in clear and  
 sound allocation of power between the federal government and  
 provinces in the ocean management and use of marine and costal 
 resources in the frames of defining the status of the territorial sea, 
 national exclusive economic zone and continental shelf of Russia.

In other words, mechanisms (legislative, economic and institutional) 
to support the activity of regional and local authorities in developing 
coastal and marine resources are needed.

	Major principles of the national maritime policy such as ecosystem- 
 based approach, adaptive management, participa tory process, 
 application of the best existing scientific and technology 
 knowledge, precautionary approach, preventive measures, 
 conservation of biodiversity, etc.

These principles have been worked out and laid down into national 
legislation of leading maritime nations and the international maritime 
law. Some of these principles are included into the national legislation 
of Russia, for example into the Federal Act on the Protection of the 
Environment or into international conventions of which Russia is a 
signatory-state, for example the Convention on Biological Diversity. 
However these principles are not considered by maritime directive 
documents including the Marine Doctrine.

	Practice of development and realization of ICZM programs in  
 the frames of complex programs of socio-economic development of  
 Russia’s coastal provinces and programs of coastal local   
 communities development as an economic and legislative instru- 
 ment of inter-sectoral coordination of different conflicting interests  
 between coastal and marine resource users first of all in a territorial  
 and spatial aspect.

There is a need for unified state management of coastal zones of 
Russia (including their both components: land and sea) based on 
global successful experience and recommendations of UN 
organizations and international fora.

	Effective and understandable mechanism of revealing and resolving  
 contradictions, first of all between the federal government,   
 provincial governments and local communities.

	Mechanism of regular system assessments (at different levels) of  
 the effectiveness of marine management and monitoring of the  
 effectiveness of the coastal area development program’s execution.

In view of this, in 2005, on request from the Marine Board, the Min-
istry of Economic Development of the Russian Federation prepared a 
draft concept of a legislative act on the state management of maritime 
activities.

Generally speaking of improving management over Russia’s marine 
activity at the present stage, it is believed that major tasks in this direc-
tion should be the following [19]:

	Specification and more precise definition of the Marine Doctrine  
 provisions (preparation of its new corrected version based on eight  
 years experience of its being in force) and its adoption by the  
 President’s decree;

	Elaboration of a draft federal legislative act on issues of state  
 management of maritime activities and the inclusion of major  
 definitions of the Marine Doctrine and provisions described above  
 into it;

	A full inventory of maritime economic activities similar to that in  
 leading maritime nations and on the similar methodological basis;

	Forming the package of national, subnational, provincial and local  
 priorities for the development of maritime economic activities,  
 based on provisions of the Marine Doctrine, system analysis of the  
 inventory results, and major global trends in studying and utilizing  
 the World Ocean’s resources, which are formulated in documents of  
 late international maritime fora. All stakeholders should be involved  
 in this process;

	Elaboration of the Strategy of Russia’s Maritime Activity   
 Development on the basis of the abovementioned priorities (which  
 should not be just a combined list of sectoral measures) and the  
 Integrated Plan for implementing this strategy.

Based on a commonly recognized consecution “concept (doctrine) 
à strategy à program”, it should be particularly mentioned that the 
elaboration and adoption of a new corrected version of the Marine 
Doctrine should precede the forming of the Strategy;

	Adaptation and mastering modern management technologies  
 (ICOM, EBOM) in Russia’s coastal zone management practices. At  
 the same time developing and implementing both sectoral strategies  
 and ICZM programs for definite coastal zones would become an  
 effective instrument of harmonizing and realizing priorities   
 identified;

	Forming a system of program measures of the Federal World Ocean  
 Program in accordance with the Strategy of Russia’s Maritime  
 Activity Development;

	Increase the role of Russia in formulation and execution of   
 international maritime policy.

Use of modern marine management models in coastal zones of Russia 
will provide for additional economic growth, competitive capacity, in-
vestment attractiveness, employment, and quality of life in the coastal 
provinces of the country, and will contribute to environmental protec-
tion and decrease damage from natural and man-caused disasters, and 
strengthen the safety of Russia. Besides, it may prevent further “creep-
ing” privatization of Russia’s coasts.

It is believed that, at the suggestion of the Ministry of Economic 
Development, modern integrated ecosystem-based ocean management 
approaches will be employed in the development of Russia’s 
Government Arctic Policy Principles. The importance of these ap-
proaches is also increasingly recognized by provincial governments. 
Thus in May 2007 in Murmansk at the joint session of the State 
Council and the Marine Board hold by President Putin, the governor of 
Murmansk Province Evdokimov said that “as far as we can see from 

ICAS 
Attachment 3



35

our place, each issue is treated separately and independently of others: 
development of shelf deposits is one thing, the Northern Sea Route is 
another one, and transport communications are a third one. No coordi-
nation exists between them”.

The work on forming ecosystem-oriented mentality in ocean and 
coastal policy and management is done through research projects and 
publications. Thus, in 2007 on request from the Federal Agency of 
Science and Innovation, Murmansk Marine Biological Institute carried 
out a project called “Developing integrated technologies for ocean and 
coastal zone management in arctic and southern seas of Russia”, which 
testifies a slow increase of attention to this problem in the Government 
of Russia. 

7. Conclusions
In Russia, as in the whole world, the last decades is characterized by 
an increase in attention to marine activity and improvement of its man-
agement. It can be noted that the basic parameters of national marine 
policy were formulated in the Russian Federation with the approval of 
the Marine Doctrine. The system of executive decision-making, which 
is necessary for implementation of a sound marine policy, has been 
developed through the creation of the Marine Board and continues to 
be improved. The Federal Target Program “World Ocean” is currently 
one of the mechanisms of implementing these decisions.

However, the aforementioned growth of activity has not yet trans-
formed into success in realizing modern integral approaches including 
Ecosystem Based Ocean Management, neither in the national marine 
policy nor in coastal and marine activity management practices. These 
approaches have yet been applied neither in directive maritime docu-
ments not in developing marine management infrastructure.

It’s obvious that Russia has just started its way towards the Ecosystem 
Based Ocean Management. It is the very stage when the idea has not 
yet been generally accepted by the society, first of all by administrative 
circles, and is just expected to be. The need for integrated approaches 
to marine activity management at all levels should be clearly stated 
by the federal legislation, taking into account that regional and local 
authorities do not fully recognize the importance of integrated ap-
proaches and are not fully able to apply them and that unstable socio-
economic situation in some regions and local communities put aside 
the solution of ecological problems.

No doubt that employment of world-acknowledged integrated ap-
proaches in ocean and coastal management practices in Russia would 
help increase their effectiveness, stimulate comprehensive develop-
ment of Russia’s maritime economic sector, and contribute to 
improvement of the state of marine environment.

1. Introduction
Finland has no truly Arctic waters, meaning marine waters that are 
geographically located in the Arctic area. However, Finland is sur-
rounded by the Baltic Sea, which is a temperate, brackish-water sea 
basin sharing many characteristics and anthropogenic pressures with 
the Arctic Ocean. Among them are coldness and annual ice cover, low 
biological diversity and relatively simple food webs which lead to 
vulnerability to pollution and overexploitation. The Baltic Sea area is 
entirely covered by territorial waters and exclusive economic zones of 
the nine coastal states (Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Latvia, 
Lithuania, Poland, Russia and Sweden). In addition, the catchment 
extends to Belarus, Czech Republic, Norway, Slovakia and Ukraine. 
All Finland’s marine territorial waters and exclusive economic zone 
are in the Baltic Sea. 

Compared to Arctic Ocean, the Baltic Sea is small and heavily influ-
enced by human activities. Baltic Sea has a large catchment area with 
85 million inhabitants. The combination of a high population density, 
intensive agriculture, and other human activities, such as emissions 
from industry and transport both on the sea and throughout its catch-
ment area are placing rapidly increasing pressure on marine ecosys-
tems. 

The environmental status in the Baltic Sea has drastically deteriorated 
over recent decades. Of the many environmental challenges, the most 
serious and difficult to tackle with conventional approaches is the 
continuing eutrophication (i.e. overload of plant nutrients into the 
sea) of the Baltic Sea. Inputs of hazardous substances also affect the 
biodiversity of the Baltic Sea and the potential for its sustainable use. 
Clear indicators of the declining environmental status of the Baltic Sea 
marine environment include problems with algal blooms, dead sea-
beds and overfishing, particularly of cod. 

The Baltic Sea area has a long industrial history, which is also reflected 
in long history of environmental problems. The sea area and water 

volume are relatively small compared to the human-induced pressures. 
To alleviate the human-induced problems it was clear already 30 years 
ago that efficient co-operation between coastal states is needed. To pro-
tect the Baltic Sea environment trough intergovernmental co-operation 
the Baltic countries have adopted the Convention on the Protection of 
the Marine Environment of the Baltic Sea Area (Helsinki Convention). 
This is the first international convention, where all sources of pollu-
tion around a sea-area were made subject to a single convention. The 
Convention aims to prevent pollution from ships (including dumping), 
pollution from land-based sources and pollution resulting from the 
exploration and exploitation of the seabed and its subsoil. The Conven-
tion was signed in 1974 by seven coastal states and entered into force 
in 1980. In order to extend, strengthen and modernize the legal regime 
for the protection of the Baltic marine environment, the Convention 
was renewed in 1992, signed by all coastal states and entered into 
force in 2000. Helsinki Commission (HELCOM) is a governing body 
of Helsinki Convention.

In this chapter, Integrated Oceans Management in Finland is treated 
in the larger context of the entire Management of the Baltic Sea under 
the auspices of HELCOM. Also other relevant international processes 
applying Ecosystem Approach to management of human activities 
aiming at protection of the Baltic Sea environment are treated.

2. Characteristics of the Baltic Sea
 

The Baltic Sea is the second largest brackish water basins with a sur-
face area of 415 000 km2 and volume of 21 000 km3. It is divided into 
several sub-regions and a transition zone to the North Sea, consisting 
of basins separated by sills. The major basins of the Baltic Sea are: 1) 
The Baltic Proper, 2) The Gulf of Bothnia, 3) The Gulf of Finland, 4) 
The Gulf of Riga and 5) The Danish Straits (Fig. 1). The mean depth 
of the Baltic Sea is only 55 m, and in the Gulf of Finland and the Both-
nian Bay less than 40 m The surface salinity varies from 9 psu in the 
southern Baltic Proper to <1 psu in the innermost parts of the Gulf of 
Finland and the Bothnian Bay. On the SW coast of Finland, the surface

salinity is usually between 5 and 6 psu and in the Quark area between 
4 and 5 psu. 

The catchment area covers 1.74 million km2, with the largest areas in 
Sweden (25.3 %), Russia (19.0 %), Poland 17.8 %) and Finland (17.4 
%). Forests cover approximately 54 % of the catchment area, agricul-
tural land 26 %, wetlands 20 % and urban areas 4 % (Fig. 1). The ten 
largest rivers account for 59 % of the total drainage area of the Baltic. 
Extensive archipelagoes are typical for the northern and north-eastern 
parts of the Sea, the total number of islands being around 200 000. 
The population density varies from less than 1 person per km2 in the 
northern and north-eastern parts of the catchment area to more than 
100 persons per km2 in the southern and south-western parts (Fig. 2). 
Land use patterns follow the population density with a high proportion 
of arable land in the eastern, southern and western parts and predomi-
nantly wooded land in the northern part.

The Baltic Sea is heavily influenced by river discharge, and the sea has 
a positive water balance, meaning that river runoff and precipitation 
exceed evaporation. The dominance of river runoff leads to estuarine 
gradients in both salinity and ecosystem variables in the North—South 
dimension, with fresher waters in the northern and eastern parts.

The brackish nature of the sea is maintained by intermittent inflows of 
saline North Sea water through the Danish Straits. These episodic in-
flows, typically of size 100-250 km3, renew the Baltic Sea deep water 
with highly saline and oxygen-rich North Sea water. The frequency 
and intensity of major inflows has decreased since mid-1970s, which 
has led to serious stagnation and hypoxia in Baltic Sea deep waters. 
Due to a strong choking effect of the shallow Danish Straits at the 
entrance of the Baltic Sea, tidal sea-level variation is generally only 
1-10 cm. In the central Baltic Proper, the water column is permanently 
stratified, with the fresher surface water separated from the deeper, 
more saline water by a halocline. In the shallow southwestern area, the 
water column may be stratified or well mixed depending on the condi-
tions. In summer, a thermal stratification of the water column occurs at 
approximately 25-30 m depth, separating the warm upper layer from 
the cold intermediate water above the halocline. 

The Baltic Sea belongs to the seasonal sea-ice zone and freezes over 
annually. The ice season in the Baltic Sea normally extends from 
October-November to May-June, with an annual areal maximum usu-
ally in late February-early March. The inter-annual variation in the ice 
cover is large, ranging from 10% to 100% of the Baltic Sea. Ice covers 
an average of approximately 200 000 km², which equals almost half 
the entire Baltic Sea. During mild winters the maximum extent of the 
ice is well below 100 000 km². 

The Baltic Sea extends over a large geographical area in the North-
South dimension, which leads to regional differences in the annual pri-
mary production dynamics caused by variations in solar radiation. The 
characteristics of ice winter also vary considerably in the sub-basins of 
the Baltic Sea. Because of its very specific characteristics, the Baltic 
Sea has quite unique fauna and flora comprising of both marine and 
freshwater organisms. Many species are living near the limits of their 
physiological tolerance range in terms of salinity. In addition, compa-
rably to the Arctic Ocean, life in the Baltic Sea requires adaptation to 
low temperatures. Due to the above mentioned reasons, biodiversity 
in the Baltic Sea is very low compared to temperate oceanic environ-
ments. Because of physiological constraints, cold temperatures and 
long residence time of the water, the Baltic Sea ecosystem is particu-
larly sensitive to persistent hazardous substances.

3. Commercial activity in the Baltic Sea
The Baltic Sea has always been of great importance to the people liv-
ing around it, providing continuous and predictable source of living, 
as well as routes for navigation. Today, shipping is the major offshore 
activity in the Baltic Sea. Other activities include construction (e.g. 
planned North Stream gas pipeline from Russia to Germany and 
several offshore wind-power parks) and sand and rock abstraction. In 
Finland, all offshore activities expect shipping are subject to environ-
mental impact assessments and permits. Fisheries remain a valuable 
part of people’s livelihood and the Baltic Sea is also a recreational 
resource of growing value. 

3.1. Maritime transport 
The Baltic Sea is one of the most intensely trafficked shipping areas 
in the world. According to HELCOM AIS (Automatic Identification 
System) data, 54 thousand vessels enter or leave the Baltic Sea annu-
ally via the Danish Straits and 40 thousand vessels enter or leave Gulf 
of Finland. At any given moment there are approximately 1800 AIS 
equipped vessels in the Baltic Sea. Both the number and size of the 
ships (especially oil tankers) have been growing during last years and 
also the amount of transported oil has increased significantly since the 
year 2000. 

Many of the major oil terminals in the Baltic Sea are located in the 
eastern Baltic Sea, especially in eastern part of the Gulf of Finland. Oil 
transport through major oil ports in the Gulf of Finland was approxi-
mately 140 million metric tons, and the transport has been projected to 
increase to 250 metric tons by 2015. Liquid bulk chemical transport in 
the Baltic Sea was 9.1 million metric tons in 2004.

Finland’s foreign trade is almost entirely dependent on maritime 
transport accounting for approximately 80 % of the trade. Amount of 
maritime transport in Finland was in 2005 in total approximately 90 
million metric tons, fuels and forest industry products being the most 
important categories in maritime import and export, respectively. 
Also passenger traffic is dominated by ship transport, the share of 
ship traveling in annual travels being approximately 70 %. In 2005 17 
million passengers were carried between Finland and other countries, 
mainly Estonia and Sweden.

One quarter of the maritime transport of goods is carried out in winter 
under ice-covered conditions. Finland is the only country in the 
world whose all international ports are annually ice-covered. Winter 
navigation in ice increases the risks of maritime transport and requires 
adequate ice strengthening for ships, icebreaker assistance services and 
continuous information on ice conditions.

The Baltic Sea has been designated as a special area under MARPOL 
73/78 Annex I, II, and V with far-reaching prohibitions and restric-
tions on any discharge into the sea of oil or oily mixtures, noxious 
liquid substances and garbage. Also discharge of untreated sewage is 
prohibited within 12 nautical miles from the nearest land. Incineration 
of wastes and dumping are prohibited. In addition, The Baltic Sea has 
been designated as a SOx emission control area under Annex VI of 
MARPOL 73/78, and all ships navigating in the area are required to 
use fuel oil with a sulphur content not exceeding 1.5 % or use special 
measures to reduce sulphur emissions. In addition to the pollution 
prevention measures listed above, the Baltic Sea states have agreed on 
certain safety measures in the Baltic Sea area, like ship routing, ship 
reporting, traffic separation schemes, pilotage and safety measures 
for winter navigation. The Baltic Sea is also designed by IMO as a 
Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA).

3.2. Baltic Sea fisheries in Finland
The Baltic Sea fisheries are managed under the EU common fisher-
ies policy (CFP). Annual total allowable catches are negotiated with 
the European Commission and allocated on national level. Formerly 
fishing quotas were internationally agreed in the Baltic Sea Fishing 
Commission, that ceased to exist beginning of 2007. The commission 
is now negotiating a new bilateral fishing agreement with Russia, that 
is only non-EU country of the Baltic Sea coastal states. 

The commercial Baltic Sea fisheries in Finland is mainly carried on in 
the Gulf of Bothnia, Gulf of Finland and the Baltic Proper. The most 
important catch species are Baltic herring, wild salmon, whitefish, 
sprat and cod. Herring is mainly fished by trawling, salmon and some 
other species like cod and flatfish by nets and long lines. Freshwater 
species, mainly pike and perch are important catch for coastal fisheries. 

There are approximately 1300 professional fishermen fishing in the 
Baltic Sea in Finland, of which full-time fishermen only 200. In total 
3900 Fishing vessels are being used in offshore and coastal fishing. 
The vessels are typically small, only 54 vessels being longer than 21 
meters.

4. Instititutions and policy for management of ma-
rine waters in Finland
Finland has relevant national legislation covering all sectors related 
to the management of the Baltic Sea. The national legislation is har-
monized with the existing EU legislation, as well as with the Helsinki 
Convention and numerous ratified IMO and UN international conven-
tions. The responsibilities on marine affairs are organized sector-wise, 
with Ministry of the Environment being responsible for environmental 
protection, Ministry of Trade and Industry for economic offshore activ-
ities (including EEZ), Ministry of Transport and Communications for 
shipping issues and Ministry for Agriculture and Forestry for fisheries. 
No permanent administrative body for coordination of marine affairs 
and integrated management exists, but coordination is done using 
normal administrative procedures and channels between the sectors 
and ministries. Temporary cross-sectoral working groups or bodies are 
being established upon need to implement national or EU legislation.

5. Introduction of Ecosystems-based oceans man-
agement in Baltic Sea (including Finland)

5.1. National Action Plan for protection of the Baltic Sea and 
inland waters
To enhance protection of the Baltic Sea and inland waters, Finland has 
developed a national Action Plan (Ministry of the environment 2005), 
which was adopted in 2005 and is currently in implementation phase. 
The Action Plan is based on government Decision-In-Principle on 
the protection of the Baltic Sea on 2002 (Ministry of the environment 
2002). The timeframe for the implementation of the Plan is by 2015 
but many measures being implemented are continuous in nature. 

The Action plan has been jointly prepared by various administrative 
sectors and other actors. The plan is organized to encompass five main 
themes: 1) Combatting eutrophication, 2) Reducing risks caused by 
hazardous substances, 3) Reducing the harmful impacts of the use of 
the Baltic Sea, 4) preserving biodiversity and 5) Increasing environ-
mental awareness. All sections are coordinated with HELCOM activi-
ties to ensure the national Action Plan’s compatibility and applicability 
for joint efforts under the auspices of HELCOM and EU in protection 
of the Baltic Sea marine environment in the coming years. 

5.1.1. Combatting eutrophication
This section includes complex and multifaceted measures to reduce 
nutrient loads entering the Baltic Sea and causing undesirable eu-
trophication effects, such as massive summertime blooms of harmful 
filamentous cyanobacteria, increased algal production 
leading to reduced water clarity and anoxic seafloor 
resulting from excess sedimenting organic matter. The 
measures are targeted to reducing nutrient loads from 
agriculture, municipal wastewater, rural settlements and 
industry. Also nutrient loads from shipping, atmospheric 
loads and loads from neighboring countries are targeted. 

5.1.2. Hazardous substances
This section includes measures to reduce emissions of 
hazardous substances (e.g. POPs, heavy metals) nation-
ally as well as to improve monitoring and international 
co-operation. Measures include both legislative controls 
and voluntary measures taken by industry. In addition 
to national legislation, EU Water framework directive 
targeted to the protection of inland and coastal waters is 
an important tool in planning and implementing emis-
sion reductions.

5.1.3. Reducing the harmful impacts of the use of the 
Baltic Sea 
The section aims at reducing risks of shipping, coastal 
and recreational use and improving the preservation of 
coastal areas. Main focus in shipping is on measures to 
reduce risks of accidental and intentional oil and chemi-
cal spills by improving general navigational safety, 
reducing deliberate illegal releases of oil by better port 

reception and surveillance as well as improving the preparedness and 
response capacity to major accidental spills. Coastal and recreational 
pressures are met with better spatial planning (including location of 
shipping lanes), better control on sand and rock extraction from seabed 
and a new national strategy for ICZM. 

5.1.4. Preserving biodiversity in marine and coastal habitats
This section aims at preserving the biological and geological diversity 
of marine habitats and preventing any decline in biodiversity. Meas-
ures taken will include a programme for inventory of marine ecosys-
tems (VELMU) that aims to identify ecologically valuable marine 
areas, indicate the activities that could endanger their favorable status. 
In addition, co-operation in nature conservation and management of 
nature reserves with neighboring countries will be improved. To pre-
vent spreading of non-indigenous species to Baltic Sea, Finland will 
actively lobby within the IMO for the signing of a binding agreement 
to restrict ballast water emissions and work within IMO and HELCOM 
to promote better technology in that particular area. 

5.2. HELCOM Baltic Sea Action Plan
HELCOM has a central role in implementation of Ecosystem Ap-
proach in management of the Baltic Sea. The Ecosystem Approach 
was adopted by joint OSPAR/HELCOM ministerial meeting in 2003 
and HELCOM subsequent actions will be based on it. HELCOM 
has developed a vision of healthy Baltic Sea, adjacent goals on four 
priority areas (mentioned below & Fig. 3) and system of Ecological 
Objectives to measure the progress towards these goals, which were 
approved in 2005. HELCOM 2007, Backer & Leppänen 2008). 

Previous HELCOM efforts have led to noticeable improvements in 
many areas, for example concerning the inputs of nutrients HELCOM 
has already achieved a 40% reduction in nitrogen and phosphorus 
discharges (from sources in the catchment area) and likewise a 40% 
decrease as regards emissions of nitrogen to the air, as well as a 
50% reduction in discharges of 46 hazardous substances. However, 
further progress cannot be achieved using only the old administrative 
measures and it is clear that a completely different approach will be 
required to restore good ecological status of the Baltic Sea. Moreover, 
the remaining challenges are more difficult than earlier obstacles. Re-
ductions of nutrient inputs have so far mainly been achieved by target-
ing major point sources, such as sewage treatment plants and industry. 
In the future diffuse sources of nutrients including over-fertilised 
agricultural lands need to be targeted, including developing economies 
in the eastern Baltic Sea area.

HELCOM has developed an ambitious strategy to restore the good 
ecological status of the Baltic Sea, called the Baltic Sea Action Plan 
(BSAP). The plan was approved by HELCOM countries in a ministe-
rial meeting in Krakow, Poland on 15th November 2007.  With BSAP 
HELCOM continues its central role in marine environmental protec-
tion in the Baltic Sea area. As one of the first schemes to implement 
the ecosystem approach to the management of human activities, BSAP 
will lead to profound, innovative changes in the ways the marine envi-
ronment in the Baltic Sea region is managed. BSAP enables wide-scale 
and decisive actions to achieve healthy marine environment, with good 
ecological status and supporting a wide range of sustainable human 
activities. This vision sets a very ambitious target of achieving a good 
ecological status for the Baltic Sea by 2021. BSAP is essentially a joint 
regional policy, with common objectives, common actions, and com-
mon obligations. Successful implementation of the plan will largely 
depend on how all the coastal countries can co-operate to achieve the 
goal of a healthy Baltic marine environment.

As the EU Marine Strategy Framework Directive foresees such an 
action plan for each European marine eco-region, including the Baltic 
Sea, BSAP has been heralded as a pilot project for European seas in 
the context of the proposed directive. The EU has described HEL-
COM’s plan as instrumental to the successful implementation of the 
new EU Marine Strategy in the region. Thus HELCOM will likely 
have a central role in the implementation of EU Marine Strategy 
Framework Directive in the Baltic Sea in the future. In developing the 
action plan, HELCOM has also taken into account the environmental 
provisions of the Maritime Doctrine of the Russian Federation. Close 
co-operation with Russia, which is the only HELCOM country outside 
the EU in the Baltic Sea region, is crucial for any further progress to be 
made in rescuing the troubled Baltic marine environment. HELCOM’s 
innovative strategy will also be instrumental to the implementation 
of the renewed Northern Dimension policy, the Baltic Sea regional 
aspects of the EU-Russian Environmental Dialogue, and the Nordic 
Environmental Action Plan.

BSAP is clearly different from previous HELCOM programmes of 
action in that it is based on a clear set of Ecological Objectives defined 
to reflect a jointly agreed vision of a healthy Baltic Sea. Example 
objectives include clear water, an end to excessive algal blooms, and 
viable populations of species. Targets for ‘good ecological status’ are 
to be based on the best available scientific knowledge. The timeframe 
for reaching the targets will be a political decision. With the ecosystem 
approach, the protection of the marine environment is no longer seen 
as an event-driven pollution reduction approach to be taken sector-
by-sector. Instead, the plan applies adaptive management of human 
actions employing cost-efficient solutions with the responsiveness of 
the marine environment as the starting point.

The plan has four main segments, according to the four main environ-
mental priorities: combating eutrophication, curbing inputs of hazard-
ous substances, ensuring maritime safety, and halting habitat destruc-
tion and the ongoing decline in biodiversity. A number of indicators 
will be selected for each objective, so that progress towards the desired 
‘good ecological status’ can be measured. These ecological objectives 
and their associated indicators will be used to evaluate the effective-
ness of existing environmental measures, and to identify where more 
measures are needed. The socio-economic component of BSAP  evalu-
ates the benefit of the measures proposed (including cost-effectiveness 
and cost-benefit analyses) compared to the socio-economic cost of 
inaction leading to further degradation of marine environment. 

BSAP distinguishes between measures that can be implemented at re-
gional or national level, and measures that can only be implemented at 
EU level (e.g. Common Fisheries Policy, Common Agricultural Policy, 
controls over the marketing and use of chemicals) or globally (e.g. the 
shipping controls defined by the International Maritime Organisation). 
Actions that need to be taken at European or global level must be ad-
dressed by HELCOM through the related international forums.
BSAP has been prepared with the active participation of all major 
stakeholder groups in the region, including governments, industry and 
NGOs, as well as individual citizens living on the shores of the Baltic 
Sea. The participation included two open stakeholder conferences in 
2006, where elaboration of the plan was officially started and 2007, 
where the first draft set of actions to be included was unveiled. Stake-

holder conferences will continue during implementation of the plan. 
Such participation scheme ensures that the plan is relevant and can be 
effectively implemented in practice. 

5.3. Relevant EU Legislation and Policies in Finland
Valid EU legislation partly directed towards better protection and 
management of the marine environment is in place and transposed 
to national legislation or in preparatory phase. This EU legislation 
includes Nitrates Directive, Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive, 
Habitats Directive, Water Framework Directive, Integrated Pollu-
tion Prevention and Control Directive and proposed Marine Strategy 
Framework Directive. 

In addition to the relevant EU legislation that has been transposed to 
national legislation, EU common policies regulate some marine-related 
affairs on Community level. The most important of them are already 
above mentioned Common Fisheries Policy and Common Agricul-
tural Policy. The Commission is currently preparing also a Common 
Maritime Policy. 

6. EU Marine Strategy and Marine Strategy 
Framework Directive 
European Union has adopted an ambitious strategy to protect more 
effectively the marine environment of EU seas, with an aim to 
achieve good environmental status by 2021. The Marine Strategy will 
constitute the environmental pillar of the future EU maritime policy. 
The adjacent Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSD, Directive 
2008/56/EC) has entered into force in July 2008. 

The Directive is using Ecosystem Approach to management and aims 
to holistic and well coordinated management and protection of EU 
seas. MSD will establish European Marine Regions on the basis of 
geographical and environmental criteria (the Baltic Sea, NE Atlantic, 
the Mediterranean Sea, Black Sea) and applies to marine waters under 
sovereignty and jurisdiction of the EU member states. Each member 
state is required to develop a detailed marine strategy for its waters 
in close co-operation with other member states and third states in the 
region (e.g. with Russia in the Baltic Sea).

The Marine Strategies will contain a detailed assessment of the state 
of the environment, a definition of “good environmental status” at 
regional level and the establishment of clear environmental targets and 
monitoring programmes. The directive will define generic descriptors 
for “Good Environmental Status”. These descriptors are to be ”disas-
sembled” into indicators in Marine Regions. To support member states, 
European Environmental Agency (EEA) is preparing a pan-european 
set of indicators that can be used in the assessments. Each member 
state will draw up a programme of cost-effective measures. Impact as-
sessments, including detailed cost-benefit analysis of the measures pro-
posed, will be required prior to the introduction of any new measure. 
Where it would be impossible for a member state to achieve the level 
of ambition of the environmental targets set, special areas and situ-
ations will be identified in order to devise specific measures tailored 
to their particular contexts. The Marine Strategy is consistent with 
EU water framework directive from 2000 which requires that surface 
freshwater and ground water bodies achieve a good ecological status 
by 2015 and that the first review of the River Basin Management Plan 
should take place in 2021.

The original MSD proposal, prepared by the European Commission 
was released in October 2005. The proposal was scrutinized in the 
European Council and European Parliament in 2006. Political agree-
ment in the European Council was attained in December 2006 under 
the Finnish Presidency, and after negotiations and amedments by the 
European Parliament. the directive was adopted on June 17th 2008 and 
entered into force in July 2008. Directive texts are available electroni-
cally at Eur-Lex service (http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexU-
riServ.do?uri=CELEX:32008L0056:EN:NOT).

7. Conclusions
Finland is surrounded by the Baltic Sea, which is a temperate, brack-
ish-water sea basin sharing many characteristics and anthropogenic 
pressures with the Arctic Ocean. Compared to Arctic Ocean, the Baltic 
Sea is small and heavily influenced by human activities. 
Shipping is the major offshore activity in the Baltic Sea and also most 
of Finland’s foreign trade is dependent on it. Other activities include 
construction and sand and rock abstraction. In Finland, all offshore 
activities expect shipping are subject to environmental impact as-
sessments and permits. Fisheries remain a valuable part of people’s 
livelihood and the Baltic Sea is also a recreational resource of growing 
value. 

The environmental status in the Baltic Sea has drastically deteriorated 
over recent decades. Of the many environmental challenges, the most 
serious and difficult to tackle with conventional approaches is the 
continuing eutrophication (i.e. overload of plant nutrients into the sea). 
Inputs of hazardous substances also affect the biodiversity of the Baltic 
Sea and the potential for its sustainable use. Clear indicators of the 
declining environmental status of the Baltic Sea marine environment 
include problems with algal blooms, dead sea-beds and overfishing.
To protect the Baltic Sea environment trough intergovernmental co-
operation the Baltic countries have adopted the Helsinki Convention. 
The Convention aims to prevent pollution from ships (including dump-
ing), pollution from land-based sources and pollution resulting from 
the exploration and exploitation of the seabed and its subsoil. Helsinki 
Commission (HELCOM) is a governing body of Helsinki Convention.
In this chapter, Integrated Oceans Management in Finland is treated 
in the larger context of the Management of the human actions in the 
entire Baltic Sea under the auspices of HELCOM. Also other relevant 
international processes applying Ecosystem Approach to management 
of human activities aiming at protection of the Baltic Sea environment 
are treated.

Finland has relevant national legislation covering all sectors related 
to the management of the Baltic Sea. The national legislation is har-
monized with the existing EU legislation, as well as with the Helsinki 
Convention and numerous ratified IMO and UN international conven-
tions. The responsibilities on marine affairs are organized sector-wise, 
with Ministry of the Environment being responsible for environmental 
protection, Ministry of Trade and Industry for economic offshore 
activities (including EEZ), Ministry of Transport and Communica-
tions for shipping issues and Ministry for Agriculture and Forestry 
for fisheries. No permanent administrative body for coordination of 
marine affairs and integrated management exists, but coordination is 
done using normal administrative procedures and channels between 
the sectors and ministries.

To enhance protection of the Baltic Sea and inland waters, Finland has 
developed a national Action Plan, which was adopted in 2005 and is 
currently in implementation phase. The plan is organized to encompass 
five main themes: 1) Combatting eutrophication, 2) Reducing risks 
caused by hazardous substances, 3) Reducing the harmful impacts of 
the use of the Baltic Sea, 4) preserving biodiversity and 5) Increasing 
environmental awareness. All sections are coordinated with HELCOM 
activities to ensure the national Action Plan’s compatibility and ap-
plicability for joint efforts under the auspices of HELCOM and EU in 
protection of the Baltic Sea marine environment in the coming years. 
HELCOM has developed an ambitious strategy to restore the good 
ecological status of the Baltic Sea, called the Baltic Sea Action Plan 
(BSAP). The plan was approved by HELCOM countries in a ministe-
rial meeting in Krakow, Poland on 15th November 2007.  With BSAP 
HELCOM continues its central role in marine environmental protec-
tion in the Baltic Sea area. As one of the first schemes to implement 
the ecosystem approach to the management of human activities, BSAP 
will lead to profound, innovative changes in the ways the marine envi-
ronment in the Baltic Sea region is managed. BSAP enables wide-scale 
and decisive actions to achieve healthy marine environment, with good 
ecological status and supporting a wide range of sustainable human 
activities. This vision sets a very ambitious target of achieving a good 
ecological status for the Baltic Sea by 2021. BSAP is essentially a joint 

regional policy, with common objectives, common actions, and com-
mon obligations. Successful implementation of the plan will largely 
depend on how all the coastal countries can co-operate to achieve the 
goal of a healthy Baltic marine environment. 

The European Union has adopted an ambitious strategy to protect 
more effectively the marine environment of EU seas, with an aim to 
achieve good environmental status by 2021. The Marine Strategy will 
constitute the environmental pillar of the future EU maritime policy. 
The adjacent Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSD) has been 
adopted and entered into force in July 2008. The Directive is using 
Ecosystem Approach to management and aims to holistic and well 
coordinated management and protection of EU seas.

MSD will establish European Marine Regions on the basis of geo-
graphical and environmental criteria (the Baltic Sea, NE Atlantic, the 
Mediterranean Sea, Black Sea) and applies to marine waters under 
sovereignty and jurisdiction of the EU member states. Each member 
state is required to develop a detailed marine strategy for its waters 
in close co-operation with other member states and third states in the 
region (e.g. with Russia in the Baltic Sea). Implementation of national 
action plan and BSAP are coherent with  the requirements of MSD and 
aimed at to be a part of MSD implementation in the future.

In conclusion, Finland, by harmonized national, HELCOM and EU 
ecosystem approach-based processes now has appropriate framework 
for ecosystem-based management of human actions relevant to the 
marine environment. Implementation of HELCOM Baltic Sea Action 
Plan and MSD is just in initial phase and evaluation of these new 
instruments remains a future task.

1. Introduction
In 2002, the Norwegian Storting (parliament) adopted a White paper 
laying out the future oceans policy of the country (St.meld. nr. 12, 
2001-2002). The White paper signaled the introduction of integrated 
oceans management, based on an ecosystems approach. The de-
velopment of integrated oceans management plans is central to the 
implementation of this policy, and the first such management plan for 
a Norwegian sea area, the Integrated Management of the Marine Envi-
ronment of the Barents Sea and the Sea Areas off the Lofoten Islands 
(BSIMP) was adopted in 2006.

The waters under Norwegian jurisdiction range from 55° N latitude 
in the North Sea to 85° N latitude north of the Svalbard archipelago 
in the Arctic Ocean a distance of more than 3300 kilometers. 1 More 
than two — thirds of the waters under Norwegian jurisdiction are 
north of the Arctic Circle. The Norwegian Sea borders the Barents 
Sea off northern North Norway and Russia to the east (Fig. 1– map). 
About 10% of Norway´s population of 4,7 million people live in the 
three northern counties: Nordland, Troms and Finnmark. The Svalbard 
archipelago is part of the Kingdom of Norway. Due to the influence of 
the Atlantic current, the climate in the Norwegian Arctic is more be-
nign than at corresponding latitudes in North America (Loeng, 1991).

This chapter addresses the development, introduction and implementa-
tion of the Integrated Management of the Marine Environment of the 
Barents Sea and the Sea Areas off the Lofoten Islands (BSIMP) in the 
context of the overall Norwegian oceans policy. The management plan 
area includes the coastal ecosystems off North Norway and parts of the 
Norwegian Sea, in addition to the Norwegian part of the Barents Sea. 
The Barents Sea falls partly under Norwegian, partly under Russian 
jurisdiction. An area in the central Barents Sea is beyond 200 nautical 
miles and therefore high seas.

2. Background
The Barents Sea – Lofoten area is a clean, rich marine area of major 
economic significance for Norway. It is a nursery area for fish stocks 
that provide the basis for significant fisheries and food for important 
seabird colonies. A number of marine mammal populations live in 
the region. The area has a rich benthic fauna including coral reefs and 
sponge communities (Føyn, et al, 2002).

The Barents Sea–Lofoten area is crossed by important transport routes, 
and is believed to contain commercially viable petroleum resources. In 
recent years there has been considerable growth in tourism. The fisher-
ies in the area are internationally significant and play an important role 
in the economy of North Norway. The sea and the fisheries are vital 
for coastal communities, and this is reflected in the ways of life and 
identity of the population.

The ecosystem
The components of the ecosystems in the Barents Sea–Lofoten area 
are closely linked. For a more detailed description see Føyn, et al. 
2002. Seabirds transfer nutrients from marine to terrestrial ecosystems. 
Fish live on the plankton production, and transfer nutrients between 
marine ecosystems as they migrate from the open sea to coastal waters. 
The area covered by the management plan consists of several naturally 
delimited ecosystems that interact and influence each other:
the Barents Sea itself, the rest of the area covered by the management 
plan (Fig. 1), which can be divided into three ecosystems: the area 
south of Tromsøflaket, the area around Svalbard, and parts of the deep-
sea areas of the Norwegian Sea. 

There are large natural fluctuations in environmental conditions 
throughout this area, for example in the inflow of Atlantic water. 
Economic activities create anthropogenic pressures on the marine 
ecosystems, as do external pressures such as long-range transboundary 
pollution. Other important potential stress factors include oil pollution 
and the spread of alien species.

The Barents Sea is relatively shallow, with an average depth of 230 
m. It is bordered in the west by the Norwegian Sea, which is more 
than 2500 m deep, and in the east by the coast of Novaya Zemlya, and 
stretches from the Norwegian and Russian coasts at its southern edge 
to about 80°N. It covers an area of about 1.4 million km2.. Several ma-
jor fish stocks in the North-east Atlantic spend part of their life cycle in 
the Barents Sea. 

The inflow of warm Atlantic water supports high biological produc-
tivity and keeps large parts of the Barents Sea ice-free year-round. 
Because the water is shallow, vertical mixing normally goes down to 
the bottom in winter, bringing nutrients up to the productive surface 
waters where they sustain biological production in spring. Variations 
in environmental conditions result in large seasonal and inter-annual 
fluctuations in the production of phyto- and zooplankton and therefore 
in the food for fish, seabirds and marine mammals. Therefore, recruit-
ment to these populations varies from year to year. The food chains in 
the Barents Sea are often relatively short, with few but robust species 
that are well adapted to the environment. There are large populations 
of individual species, and they may have wide distribution ranges. 
Even though individual species are robust, the environmental press-
ures may have significant impact when food chains are short. Some 
fish species, such as herring and cod, spend parts of the year or part 
of their life cycle in the Barents Sea and the rest along the Norwegian 
mainland coast and in the Norwegian Sea. For polar cod and capelin, 
the Barents Sea is a spawning ground, nursery area and feeding area. 
When the inflow of Atlantic water is high, the temperature in the 
Barents Sea rises. This allows fish such as herring and cod and other 
marine organizms whose distribution to a certain degree is limited by 
low temperatures to expand their ranges. Cooling of the Barents Sea, 
on the other hand, is favorable for capelin. 

The marginal ice zone can be considered as a separate ecosystem that 
retreats gradually northwards in spring and summer. This creates par-
ticularly favorable conditions for phyto- and zooplankton production. 
Capelin feed on these organisms, and transport energy from biological 
production in the marginal ice zone to coastal waters further south 
where they spawn. Thus, seabirds and other species associated with 
coastal areas also benefit from production in the northern parts of the 
Barents Sea.

The high production of plankton and fish in the Barents Sea supports 
some of the largest seabird colonies in the world, totally about 25 mil-
lion birds. Most of these migrate out of the region in winter. A number 
of marine mammals forage in the Barents Sea and calve in temperate 
waters further south (minke whale, humpback whale, fin whale), while 
some spend their whole lives in the Arctic (beluga whale, narwhal). 
The large populations of harp seal and minke whales consume consid-
erable quantities of cod, herring and capelin. Russian scientists have 
estimated that the total biomass of benthic animals in the Barents Sea 
is about 150 million tons, with an annual production of 25–30 million 
tons. About 3000 marine species have been recorded. Relatively little 
is known about the distribution of benthic animals. Sponges and corals 
dominate the seabed in certain areas.
 
Commercial activities
The main commercial activity of the management plan area is fisher-
ies. The Barents Sea is one of the world’s most important fishing areas. 
Fishing of North-east Arctic cod, North-east Arctic haddock, capelin, 
herring, tusk, ling, wolf-fish, deep-sea redfish, North-east Atlantic 
Greenland halibut and shrimp and king crab trawling is/had been car-
ried out in the area. Most fisheries in the Barents Sea are sustainable 
(IMR 2008:11). North-east Arctic cod (510 000 tons in 2007 is the 
most important fishery. Overfishing has been substantial, but has been 
declining since 2006. Overfishing of biological resources has negative 
consequences for the ecosystems of which those resources are integral 
parts. In addition, benthic communities may be disturbed by trawls. 
Also, by-catches of seabirds and marine mammals can be a problem in 
certain areas and at certain times of year. 

Minke whales (the quota for 2008 was 900 animals in the North-
eastern stock area, of which 535 were caught,) is the only species of 
whale hunted for commercial purposes in the management plan area. 
Some seals (common, grey, bearded and ringed) where some indi-

viduals are taken by local hunters and residents in the settlements of 
Svalbard and northern Norway. The commercial hunting grounds for 
harp and hooded seals lie outside the management plan area.

Petroleum-related activities are growing in the management plan 
area. Seismic surveys and exploration drilling for oil and gas began in 
1980. Up to 2008, about 80 exploration and appraisal wells have been 
drilled. Discoveries are mainly gas, but also some oil. The gas and 
condensate field “Snøhvit” northwest of Hammerfest came on stream 
in 2007. The Ministry of Petroleum and Energy expect to receive a 
plan for the development of the oil field Goliat in 2009. The Barents 
Sea North of 74° 30’ is not open for petroleum prospecting. 

Also transportation is a major activity in the management plan area. 
Traffic involving fishing vessels, cargo vessels and passenger ships 
can have adverse impacts on the environment through operational 
discharges to water and air, releases of pollutants from anti-fouling 
systems, noise, the introduction of alien species via ballast water or 
attached to hulls and local discharges from zinc anodes in ballast 
tanks. In addition, an increase in maritime transport will increase the 
risk of accidental spills of oil and chemicals.  From 2002 to 2020, it 
is estimated that the total distance sailed will rise by 27.7 per cent for 
cargo ships, 22.7 per cent for passenger ships and 9.4 per cent for fish-
ing vessels. 

Tourism has its most important effects on land. Marine systems can 
however also be affected, for example by disturbance of seabird nest-
ing areas and moulting and birthing sites for seals. Cultural remains 
associated with old hunting sites exist in these areas. According to the 
office of the Governor of Svalbard, the total number of tourist landing 
sites outside the settlements and Isfjorden has increased from 56 in 
1996 to 168 in 2007. 

The scale and frequency of pressure factors and the vulnerability of the 
environment will determine the extent of the impacts.

3. Institutions and policy
Regulatory frameworks have been developed for most marine policy 
areas with the establishment of ministries, agencies, and legislation in 
the period after World War II. The domestic oceans regime is based on 
the 1976 Economic Zone Act, which extends jurisdiction over living 
marine resources to 200 nautical miles and reserves the utilization of 
those resources for Norwegian vessels. The continental shelf resources 
and their exploitation are regulated by the 1996 Petroleum Act. Still 
other acts elaborate the regulatory framework for petroleum resources, 
fisheries, and the environment. The acts provide for enabling legisla-
tion to facilitate the adaptation of regulations to changing circum-
stances. 

The EEZ off the Norwegian mainland was established on 1 January 
in 1977 (Fig. 1). In 1978 a 200 nautical mile fisheries protection zone 
was established around Svalbard. The extension of jurisdiction brought 
jurisdictional issues with neighboring countries. In the Barents Sea, 
talks to establish a boundary there have been held between Norway 
and Russia since the mid-1970s.2 A second jurisdictional issue con-
cerns the fishery protection zone around Svalbard. 

Most of the Norwegian fisheries occur on stocks that are shared with 
other countries. International cooperation is therefore critical to their 
management. A number of bi- and multilateral agreements have 
therefore been negotiated with neighboring countries to provide for 
the management of shared fish stocks, the most important of which 
are those with Russia and the EU. Norway is also party to the North 
East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC), which manages the 
fisheries at the high seas in the region. The Joint Norwegian-Russian 
Fisheries Commission meets annually to agree on total allowable 
catches (TACs) of shared stocks and on the allocation of quotas for the 
major fisheries in the Barents Sea. About ten per cent of the total quota 
is traded to third countries. The cooperation also includes fisheries 

research and enforcement of fisheries regulations. The Commission in 
2002 adopted a management strategy with multi-annual quotas based 
on a precautionary approach. 
The fisheries policy include limits to access to fisheries, restrictions on 
catches (quotas), and technical regulations on fishing gear to be used 
and fishing seasons and areas. Important aspects are discard bans and 
flexible closures of areas with juvenile fish. There are virtually no open 
access fisheries in Norway. The enforcement of fisheries regulations 
occurs both at sea and when the fish is landed. The Coast Guard (a 
service in the Navy) is responsible for inspecting fishing vessels at sea. 
The sales organizations buying the fish and the Directorate of Fisheries 
control landings.

IUU fishing is a challenge to enforcement of fisheries regulations 

in Norway, as elsewhere.3 Ships flying flags of convenience and 
transshipment of cargo on the high seas make enforcement difficult. 
Increased international cooperation on enforcement has been important 
in coming to grips with this. 

The management of marine mammals is vested in the International 
Whaling Commission (IWC), the North Atlantic Marine Mammals 
Commission (NAMMCO), and the Joint Norwegian-Russian Fisheries 
Commission. Controversies over whether whales should be subject to 
harvest have paralyzed the IWC, which has not set quotas for commer-
cial fisheries for more than two decades. Since 1993 Norway has set 
unilateral quotas for the take of minke whales on the basis of the work 
in the IWC Scientific Committee. 

As with fisheries, maritime transport is to a large extent regulated by 
international rules that provides a framework for how Norway can 
regulate transport activities in its waters. The Coastal Administration 
has the operational responsibility for the governmental emergency 
response system for acute pollution. It is also tasked with ensuring 
that the damage-reducing measures implemented by other bodies are 
adequate.

The chief objective of the Norwegian petroleum policy is to maximize 
the returns from the industry for the good of the society. National 
control over the industry, the development of a domestic petroleum 
industry, and participation by the state are key elements of the policy. 
The development of a comprehensive institutional framework has 
been critical to the achievement of the objectives. The 1996 Petroleum 
Act provides for a licensing system that is the core of the regulatory 
regime. The act empowers the government to regulate all aspects of 
the industry. 

Petroleum activities are subject to a strict regulatory regime: Explora-
tory drilling has to be approved by the Petroleum Directorate and the 
State Pollution Control Authority. New fields to be developed and 
the laying of pipelines require the consent of parliament or govern-
ment, depending on the scale of the project. Also, operators have to 
undertake environmental and socio-economic assessments and subject 
them to public hearings before government approval is granted. The 
petroleum industry is a major contributor of emissions to air. For 
CO2, 28 per cent of the national emissions stem from the petroleum 
industry’s production of energy at the petroleum installations. In 1991 
Norway introduced a CO2 tax, aimed at reducing emissions. The 1981 
Pollution Control Act imposes a number of restrictions on emissions 
and discharges. 

The petroleum industry is taxed in the same way as other businesses, 
i.e. a 28 per cent tax on net income. A special tax of 50 per cent, 
justified by the super-profitability from resource rent, is levied on top 
of that. The income from the petroleum activities is of great signifi-
cance to the public finances. To maintain the level of revenue gener-
ated by the industry and the activity in associated industries, new fields 
have to be found and brought into operation at regular intervals. The 
southern part of the Norwegian continental shelf is now relatively well 
explored, and activity is therefore moving northwards in search of new 
fields. Developments in technology are making operations in Arctic 

2 The entire Barents Sea is a continental shelf area and will eventually be divided   
 between Russia and Norway. As to the waters, there is an enclave of the high seas  
 known as the “Barents Sea Loophole.”

3 In recent years, IUU fishing in the Barents Seas is estimated to have been 100,000  
 tons or more annually. Since 2006 these figures have been declining and are now a  
 fraction of that.

waters feasible. The price of oil and gas is also an important factor in 
this regard.

Environmental concerns are generally considered an important issue 
in the Norwegian polity. Ministries are required to check their policies 
against specific environmental standards. The constitution of Norway 

explicitly states the right to a good environment4 The Ministry of the 
Environment has several designated agencies,5 and several important 
Acts regulate use and protection of the marine environment. The 
primary international environmental agreements are the OSPAR 
cooperation on the marine environment in the north-east Atlantic 
and the Kyoto Protocol, as well as IMO-agreements and the London 
Dumping Convention. Organic compounds, oil, and chemicals used in 
petroleum production are the most significant discharges to the sea in 
Norwegian waters. Domestic regulation of such emissions is largely 
mandated by OSPAR, and includes the objective of zero harmful 
discharges to the sea. 

4. The process of introducing ecosystem-based 
oceans management
During the debate on the white paper on the marine environment 
(Report No. 12 (2001–2002) Protecting the Riches of the Sea, the 
Storting endorsed the need for integrated management of Norwegian 
maritime areas based on the ecosystem approach. This is in line with 
international developments in regional cooperation in the north-east 
Atlantic within the framework of OSPAR, the Arctic Council, and the 
North Sea Conferences. 

The decision-making process and stakeholder involvement
All major policy sectors in the marine realms have strong international 
dimensions. The most significant pollution problems in Norway are 
brought from abroad by ocean currents and winds. Major fish stocks 
are shared with other countries. And due to the small domestic market, 
fisheries products as well petroleum production have to be exported. 
The international aspects of marine policy in Norway can therefore 
hardly be overstated. 

Norway is a parliamentary democracy. The government remains in 
power as long as it has the confidence of the majority in parliament, 
the “Storting”. Its political system includes a strong tradition for 
participation of organized interests in the formulation and execution of 
public policies (Olsen 1983), a comparatively high degree of centrali-
zation of decision-making power, and a relatively consensual political 
process (Heidar 2001) where the differences between political parties 
may be difficult to discern as viewed from abroad. The implication is 
that policy-making in the marine sectors tends to involve interests that 
are likely to be affected by decisions, which is also a legal require-
ment. The ministries are the hubs of decision-making, with little or no 
powers devolved to regions.6 

The Saami Parliament has entered into a consultation agreement with 
the Norwegian government. This mandates a consultation procedure 
on all matters pertaining to Saami culture, and requires that its Parlia-
ment should have real influence on decisions affecting its remit. The 
Saami Parliament is however not satisfied with the actual use of the 
procedure, and has noted that there were no consultations on the Bar-
ents Sea Management Plan.7 It was however part of the regular hearing 
process in advance of the adoption of the plan. Following the adoption 
of the plan the Saami Parliament has been invited to the meetings of 
the Reference Group that considers the implementation of the 
management plan.

Marine issues are important in the domestic political debate, due 
to their economic significance and political salience. In addition to 
economic interests, non-state actors such as environmental non-
governmental organizations (NGOs), regional political bodies, and in-
digenous groups are increasingly engaged in issues relating to marine 
policies. This is a development that tends to bring increased levels of 
controversy. In fisheries, stakeholders are involved in decision-making 
through a Regulatory Meeting arranged regularly by the Fisheries 
Directorate. 

An important part of the decision-making context is that as the 
management plan was developed, new legislation was developed 
pertaining to ocean resources and biodiversity conservation, respec-
tively. The new Oceans Resources Act was adopted by the Storting 
in May 2008.  The act consolidates all relevant provisions for the 
management of living marine resources into a single act, thereby 
facilitating its implementation. Its overall objective is to ensure an 
economically and ecologically sustainable management of wild marine 
living resources (including genetic resources) by sustainable use and 
long-term conservation of the resources. The act states that the natural 
resources are the property of the state as long as they are in the wild. 
The act also lists principles and concerns to be taken into considera-
tion in the management of resources, among them the precautionary 
approach, an ecosystem-based approach, implementation of inter-
national law, transparency in decision-making, and regard for the 
Saami culture. The act makes explicit the legal basis for marine 
protected areas. It also provides that in implementing an ecosystem-
based approach, precise resource management objectives can be 
established. The act therefore provides a more modern and appropriate 
basis for the management plan than previous legislation. 

A new act on biodiversity conservation is also in the works, intended 
to be submitted to parliament in 2009. The principle of sustainable 
use is central to the law, and it is to be implemented through the 
establishment of conservation objectives for nature types and species, 
and through the enactment of certain environmental principles: the 
precautionary principle, the polluter pays principle, and the principle 
of responsible technologies and practices. 

Knowledge
In fisheries, the basis for resource management is the scientific advice 
provided by the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 
(ICES). Based on inputs from research institutions in the member 
countries, ICES assess the status of fish stocks and marine ecosystems 
and provides scientific advice on conservation measures to member 
states and regional fisheries management organizations. The primary 
marine research institution in Norway is the Institute of Marine Re-
search.

In the context of the development of the Management Plan for the 
Barents Sea the task of knowledge development was complex and de-
manding. Large and challenging knowledge gaps were identified that 
have to be filled to enable the design and long-term implementation 
of scientifically sound and adequate monitoring of essential elements 
of the Barents Sea ecosystem. The knowledge gaps were categorized 
as monitoring, research and mapping needs. During the process there 
have been a unanimous call for the development and implementation 
of better procedures for how new knowledge gaps can be identified, 
prioritized and filled as well as finding good procedures for handling 
scientific uncertainty.

Interagency cooperation and the development of the plan
A multi-sector approach lies at the core of the ecosystem approach, 
as multiple concerns and economic sectors have to be coordinated 
and reconciled. Work on the management plan started in 2002 after 
the adoption of the white paper on the marine environment, and was 
organized through an inter-ministerial Steering Committee chaired by 
the Ministry of the Environment. Other members of the Steering Com-
mittee were the Ministry of Labor and Social Inclusion (from June 
2005), the Ministry of Fisheries and Coastal Affairs, the Ministry of 
Trade and Industry (from November 2005), the Ministry of Petroleum 
and Energy and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The analytical work 
started in 2002, and was carried out by government directorates and 
institutions under the four Ministries as well as some external institu-
tions. The Institute of Marine Research and the Norwegian Polar Insti-
tute were leading several of the assessments and analyses. Fig. 2 gives 
an overview of the development process, which essentially evolved 
through three phases. 

The initial scoping phase entailed the production of status reports for 
various economic sectors in the region, valuable areas, the

6  Coastal zone planning is an exception. The municipal authorities have substantial  
 powers to plan and execute local policies regarding use of the coastal zone.

socio-economic situation, and the environment and natural resources. 
The second phase consisted of assessments of potential impacts of 
petroleum activities, shipping, and fisheries, as well as the impact 
of external stressors as for example climate change. This phase also 
entailed consultation with relevant stakeholders. The final phase in the 
development of the plan included aggregate analyses, assessing the 
total impact on the environment, identifying valuable and vulnerable 
areas, defining knowledge gaps, and the setting of management goals. 
Also, in this phase a stakeholder conference with broad participation 
was held. 

A key challenge during the development of the plan was to integrate 
work across institutional sector barriers at both ministry and agency 
levels. Success depended in large measure on allowing non-specialists 
to have a say in how a specific sector was to be managed, or how to 
assess the impact of that sector in relation to the ecosystem. This was a 
difficult process, requiring care and time, but in the end it succeeded. 

Adoption of the plan
The Management Plan for the Barents Sea was presented to the Stort-
ing as a government white paper in March 2006 (Report No. 8 
(2005-2006) to the Storting), and was adopted in June the same year. 
While the process leading up to the adoption of the plan was sur-
rounded by some controversy over the extent of limitations to be 
placed on petroleum-related activities in the plan area, the actual work 
of developing the plan, which implied cross-sector collaboration, was 
relatively uncontroversial.

Geographical area
The Management plan area covers the Norwegian Economic Zone and 
the fisheries protection zone around Svalbard (Fig. 1), limited to the 
east by the border with Russia. The plan area extends southwest to in-
clude the Lofoten area, and west past the continental shelf break in the 
Norwegian Sea. The areas closer than 1 nautical mile to shore are to 
be managed according to the EU Water Management directive.  Inside 
the area the plan aims to lay the overall foundations for the integrated 
management of all human activities, in order to ensure the continued 
health and safety of the entire marine ecosystem and the human com-
munities dependent on its functions.

5. Implementation of the integrated management 
plan for the Barents Sea 

The government white paper
The notion of an ecosystem approach implies that different types of 
uses of the ocean environment have to be reconciled, in order to realize 
the objective of sustainable use of the oceans. While this understand-
ing of the ecosystem-based approach to oceans management may 
appear uncontroversial, decisions will in fact have to be made that 
favor certain interests at the expense of others. The approach taken 
in Norway through the integrated management plan is rather techni-
cal:  ordering of priorities, selection of criteria and collection of data 
to assess against them. On the basis of that the optimal choice can be 
derived. 

Sector based actions
Fisheries have a substantial impact on the ecosystem in the Barents 
Sea. The fishery authorities’ responsibility is to continue to develop 
an ecosystem-based approach for that particular sector. Initiatives 
and measures here include bringing down illegal, unreported and 
unregulated fishing (IUU fishing), rebuilding certain fish stocks that 
have been depleted, increasing the general knowledge of distribution 
and ecology of relevant species, reduction of by-catches and damag-
ing of benthic communities by fishing gears, and the development of 
selective fishing gear such as sorting grids. In the petroleum sector, 
comprehensive legislation and control and enforcement procedure en-
sure that the impact of petroleum activities on the environment and any 
inconvenience to other industries are dealt with. The decision to open 
an area for petroleum activity is made by the Storting. Specifically for 

the management plan area and the North, is the requirement that 
drilling operations in the north are required to have zero discharges.8 
The plan also places significant restrictions on when and where  
petroleum-related activities can take place (Fig. 5). The 2006 white 
paper on the management plan summarized the general negative 
effects the oil and gas industry can have on the environment through 
operational discharges of chemicals and oil to the sea, mechanical 
disturbance of the seabed, the effects of seismic surveys on fish and 
marine mammals, and emissions of NOx, VOCs and CO2 to air.  
However, the conclusion was that given the strict standards that apply 
to petroleum activities in the Barents Sea, discharges to the sea and 
mechanical disturbances of the seabed are not expected to have  
significant environmental impacts. That leaves possible negative 
effects of larger accidental oil spills as the only potential significant 
environmental impact. 

The relationship between fisheries and petroleum activities is a major 
environmental issue. The general experience from the North Sea is 
that fisheries and the petroleum industry can coexist. The increase in 
petroleum-related activities in the north has, however, brought a new 
awareness of the interactions of petroleum activities and fisheries. 
Among the contentious issues are the effects of seismic surveys on 
fisheries. A number of measures have been devised to limit potential 
damage from potential oil spills. 

Policy tools for integrated oceans management
The plan itself establishes a number of policy tools:  area-based 
management, species management, ecosystem indicators, and risk 
evaluation. In addition, the concept of valuable and vulnerable areas is 
a centerpiece of the plan.

Area-based management 
Area-based management is a major policy tool in the context of the 
management plan. For areas identified as particularly valuable and vul-
nerable (Box below), special caution will be required and special con-
siderations will apply to the assessments of standards for and restric-
tions on activities. In these areas activities should be conducted in such 
way that all ecological functions and biodiversity are maintained. In 
addition, a network of marine protected areas, including the southern 
part of the management area, will be established in Norwegian waters, 
at the latest by 2012 in order to maintain biodiversity and keep certain 
areas undisturbed.9 The Nature Conservation Act provides the legal 
basis for permanent and general protection of areas against activities 
that have an impact on the environment and natural resources.

In the management plan area, several sub-areas are identified as par-
ticularly valuable and vulnerable (Fig. 4). Vulnerability is 
assessed with respect to specific environmental pressures such as oil 
pollution, fluctuation in food supply and physical damage.When 
assessing vulnerability, type of impact and duration has been consid-
ered. Differentiating between natural and human-induced pressures on 
the environment is however difficult. Furthermore, an area is usually 
not equally vulnerable all year round, and all species in an area will 
not be equally vulnerably in relation to a specific environmental 
pressure. Vulnerability can be measured at individual, population, 
community and ecosystem level. 

8  Except for those resulting from the drilling of the top-hole section for surface casing.

9  A plan for marine protected areas has been drawn up, but the final selection of areas will  
 be decided by the Ministry of the Environment, in cooperation with the Ministries of  
 Fisheries and Coastal Affairs, Trade and Industry, and Petroleum and Energy.

The most important criteria for selecting the valuable and 
vulnerable areas were: 

	whether it supports high production and high concentration of 
 species

	whether it includes a large proportion of endangered or   
 vulnerable habitats

 whether it is a key area for species for which Norway has a   
 special responsibility or for endangered or vulnerable species

	whether it supports internationally or nationally important   
 populations of certain species all year round or at specific times  
 of the year

Negative pressures in these areas will in some cases affect a great 
deal of a population or a great deal of the ecosystem and might 
persist for many years.

An example of area-based management in effect is the framework for 
petroleum activities based on an evaluation of the particularly valuable 
and vulnerable areas and an assessment of the risk of acute oil pollu-
tion (Fig. 5). In some areas no petroleum activity will be permitted at 
all, while in others no new activity will be permitted or it can occur but 
not between 1 March and 31 August. Based on new knowledge gained 
through research, monitoring and ongoing activities this framework 
will be re-evaluated when the management plan is updated in 2010. 

Another example of areas-based management is the mandatory routing 
and traffic separation scheme for maritime transport 30 nautical miles 
from the coast. This arrangement is precautionary, to reduce the risk 
of acute oil pollution from ships. This is still close enough to be within 
the coverage area of a special system for traffic surveillance and con-
trol (the Coastal Administration’s AIS system), but at the same time far 
enough out to allow a certain response time in case of an oil spill. 

A third example involving area-based management is temporary or 
permanent closure of areas to for example certain types of fishing gear 
motivated by the type of benthic community, underwater cultural herit-
age, or unwanted changes in commercial fish stock sizes and the size 
and age structure of these stocks. Marine protected areas have been 
established under the fisheries legislation to protect coral reefs from 
damage caused by bottom trawling in the Barents Sea – Lofoten Area.  

Species management
Another important policy measure is species management. Norway 
has signed a number of international agreements and conventions on 
species protection and management, e.g. the Convention on Biological 
Diversity (CBD), the Convention on Trade in Endangered Species of 
Wild Animals (CITES), the Convention on the Conservation of Migra-
tory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), the Agreement on North Atlantic 
Marine Mammal Commission (NAMMCO), the Agreement on the 
Conservation of Polar Bears and their Habitats, etc. To implement 
these, the Government has established a set of objectives for species 
management in the Barents Sea – Lofoten area. They are listed in the 
white paper on the management plan (Report No. 8 (2005-2006) to the 
Storting):

 Naturally occurring species will exist in viable populations and  
 genetic diversity will be maintained.
 
 Harvested species will be managed within safe biological limits so  
 that their spawning stocks have good reproductive capacity.
 Species that are essential to the structure, functioning, 
 productivity and dynamics of ecosystems will be managed in such  
 a way that they are able to maintain their role as key species in the  
 ecosystem concerned.
 
 Populations of endangered and vulnerable species and species  
 for which Norway has a special responsibility will be maintained  
 or restored to viable levels. Unintentional negative pressures on  
 such species as a result of activity in the Barents Sea – Lofoten area  
 will be reduced as much as possible by 2010.The introduction of  
 alien species through human activity will be avoided.

Ecosystem indicators
A third policy tool is ecosystem indicators. It is desirable to be able to 
evaluate the state of the ecosystem, i.e. ecological quality, at any given 
time. In order to do so a set of indicators have been identified. It is 
important to choose indicators that give information about the state of 
a particular part of the ecosystem at a given point in time. Relevance to 
ecosystem management, relevance in relation to Norway’s internation-
al obligations, feasibility in practice, and their role in the ecosystem 
are criteria used here. The indicators can be grouped into those which 
reveal something about the physical state of the water bodies in the 
Barents Sea and the production of phytoplankton and zooplankton, and 
indicators for components of the ecosystem that live on this  
production.

A satisfactory evaluation of environmental status is only possible when 
different indicators are combined with background information, like 
distributions maps for various species, information about ecology etc. 
One challenge is to distinguish between the effects of human activity 
and natural fluctuation in the ecosystem. 

Based on the chosen indicators, a monitoring system is set up. The 
management plan emphasize that the system must be dynamic and 
flexible enough to be changed and updated in the light of new knowl-
edge. Furthermore, additional ongoing monitoring in the Barents Sea 
will also be used in the yearly evaluation of the state of the ecosystem 
carried out by the Advisory Group on monitoring of the Barents Sea.

Risk evaluation
There will always be a risk connected to petroleum activities and 
maritime transport in the Barents Sea. Risk evaluation is therefore 
important in the assessment of policy measures. Maritime transport 
contributes considerable more to the overall risk of acute oil pollution 
than the oil and gas industry in the management plan area. However, 
in spite of an expected increase in the volume of maritime transport by 
2020, the implementation of measures such as the already mentioned 
minimum sailing distance from the cost, traffic separation schemes and 
vessel traffic service centers will reduce the risk of oil spills associated 
with maritime transport by half from 2003 to 2020.

Based on risk identification and understanding of possible accidents 
scenarios and their consequences appropriate emergency response 
systems can be put in place. Based on an evaluation of whether there 
is adequate basis for decision-making or not, possible actions to 
reduce uncertainty etc., risk-based decisions are taken. Models and 
risk analysis are being used as tools to estimate risk. They focus on 
different aspects of risk, e.g. the probability of accidental discharges, 

 The most important criteria for selecting the valuable and  
 vulnerable areas were: 
 whether it supports high production and high concentration of 
 species

 whether it includes a large proportion of endangered or vulnerable  
 habitats

 whether it is a key area for species for which Norway has a   
 special  responsibility or for endangered or vulnerable species

 whether it supports internationally or nationally important 
 populations of certain species all year round or at specific times  
 of the year

 Negative pressures in these areas will in some cases affect a 
 great deal of a population or a great deal of the ecosystem and  
 might persist for many years. 

Elements of the monitoring system as they are defined in the 
white paper on the management plan include the following 
concepts:

Ecological quality
The ecological quality of an ecosystem is an expression of the 
state of the system, taking into account the physical, biological 
and chemical conditions, including the effects of anthropogenic 
pressures.

Indicators
An indicator is a variable that in present context provides specific 
information about a particular part of the ecosystem. Indicators 
will be used to assess how far the management goals have been 
reached and whether trends in the ecosystem are favorable.

Reference values
Reference values correspond to the ecological quality expected 
in a similar but more or less undisturbed ecosystem, adjusted for 
natural variation and development trends. Precautionary reference 
values are used for harvestable stocks.

Action thresholds
The action threshold is the point at which a change in an indicator 
in relation to the reference value is so grate that new measures 
must be considered.

the probability of oil contamination, the risk of damage and potential 
damage-related costs. It is however, important to be aware of the pros, 
cons and limitations of these tools. Risk will also change over time due 
to change in traffic volume, implantation of measures, lessons learned 
from accidents, new technology etc

6. Conclusions 
The Management Plan for the Barents Sea provides a foundation for 
co-existence of industries as well as measures for addressing the main 
challenges relating to pollution and the maintenance of biodiversity. 
Ecosystem-based management calls for cooperation across sectors, 
both with respect to monitoring, mapping and research. 

The responsibility for increasing knowledge about the different pres-
sures on the environment, as well as the implementation and enforce-
ment of regulations and laws relating to the management plan, resides 
with the sector-based ministries and agencies. Norway is a relatively 
small country with an efficient and homogenous central administration, 
and coordination can be achieved between ministries and agencies 
from different sectors. The overall responsibility for the implementa-
tion of the plan however resides with the Ministry of the Environment. 

Also, the implementation of the management plan is based on existing 
legislation. Recently, new legislation for the management of oceans 
resources have been adopted, and new legislation on the conserva-
tion of biodiversity are in the process of being developed. These acts 
emphasize the ecosystem approach to the management of marine 
ecosystems and the natural resources there.

A close international cooperation, particularly with Russia, is a 
premise for satisfactory management of the Barents Sea. In fisheries 
management, Norway and Russia has had a bilateral cooperation in a 
Joint Fisheries Commission since 1975.10 In environmental manage-
ment, Norway and Russia has had a Joint Commission on Environ-
mental Protection since 1988. In 2005 a Marine Environment group 
was established under this commision, with the aim of enhancing 
cooperation on ecosystem-based management of the Barents Sea. A 
team of Norwegian and Russian scientists is currently preparing a joint 
assessment of the state of the environment and biological resources 
for the whole of the Barents Sea, as a basis for further cooperation on 
ecosystem-based management.

Permanent working groups
The actual work of implementing the management plan relies heav-
ily on a tight integration between science and relevant management 
agencies. In response to the adoption of the management plan three 
permanent working groups have been established:

 An advisory group on monitoring to assist in coordination of the  
 system proposed by the Government for monitoring the state of the  
 environment

 A forum on environmental risk management focusing on acute pol 
 lution in the area, which will provide valuable input to 
 environmental risk assessments

 A forum responsible for the coordination and overall 
 implementation of the scientific aspects of ecosystem-based 
 management

The different groups have a broad membership, with representatives 
from the relevant public institutions with responsibility for and exper-
tise in the various sectors, but will also draw on expertise from other 
sources as necessary. The groups report to a Steering group headed 
by the Ministry of Environment and in which relevant Ministries par-
ticipate. In order to make sure that that the various business, industry, 
environmental organizations and Sami groups have their say on the im-
plementation of the plan, a reference group has been established. The 
meetings of the reference group are open and all relevant stakeholders 
have an opportunity of be informed of the work and let their voice be 
heard in this regard. 

10 Scientific cooperation in the Barents Sea goes at least back to the 1950s.

Updating the plan
While the plan was adopted in 2006, it is now under revision to take 
into account new knowledge and changing situations. None of the 
regulations are set in stone, but up for revision as new and better 
knowledge becomes available. The first revision of the plan will take 
place in 2010, while a new management plan also for the Norwegian 
Sea will be adopted in 2009. Following the first update of the plan in 
2010, there will be an updated version of the whole Barents Sea man-
agement plan in 2020 with a time frame up to 2040.

1. Introduction
The waters around Iceland, fed by the warm Gulf Stream, offer excep-
tional conditions for fish stocks to thrive, making  Iceland’s exclusive 
fishing zone of 758,000 km2 some of the richest fishing grounds in the 
world. The currents and topography around Iceland provide oceano-
graphic conditions that give relatively closed system on the continental 
shelf around the island. The geographical position of Iceland on the 
ocean ridges means that the country is in the vicinity of mixing areas 
of the warm and cold currents. The warm North Atlantic current origi-
nating in the Gulf of Mexico meets with the polar East Greenland cur-
rent, flowing south along the East Greenland coast. Close to the coast 
there is a coastal current which flows clockwise around Iceland and is 
formed by mixing of warm oceanic water with fresh water from land. 
Due to these rather well defined conditions the area around Iceland has 
been defined as one of the large marine ecosystems (LME).

Icelandic policy on ocean issues is based on maintaining the future 
health, biodiversity and sustainability of the oceans surrounding 
Iceland, in order that it may continue to be a resource that sustains and 
promotes the nation´s welfare. This means sustainable utilization,   
conservation and management of the resource based on scientific 
research and applied expertise guided by respect for the marineeco-
system as a whole. The health of the ocean and sustainable utilization 
of its living resources provides one of the main basis for Iceland´s 
economic welfare.

Understanding the marine ecosystem is the foundation of sensible and 
sustainable harvesting of the resources. The fishing industry is one of 
the main pillars of the Icelandic economy. Responsible fisheries at the 
Icelandic fishing grounds are the prerequisite for the Icelandic fishing 
industry continuing being a solid part of the Icelandic economy and a 
principal pillar in Iceland’s exports. 

Icelanders have structured a fisheries management system to ensure 
responsible fisheries, focusing on the sustainable utilisation of the fish 
stocks and good treatment of the marine ecosystem. The fisheries man-
agement in Iceland is primarily based on extensive research on the fish 
stocks and the marine ecosystem, decisions made on the conduct of 
fisheries and allowable catches on the basis of scientific advice, and ef-
fective monitoring and enforcement of the fisheries and the total catch. 

2. The Icelandic government policy
In light of the importance of marine resources for Iceland, the govern-
ment has adopted a clear and responsible long-term policy.

The principal objectives of Icelandic policy on the ocean are to 
maintain the ocean´s health, biodiversity and productive capacity, in 
order that its living resources can continue to be utilised sustainably. 
This means sustainable utilisation, conservation and management of 
the resource based on research, technology and expertise, directed by 
respect for the marine ecosystem as a whole.

The policy is based on three pillars. Firstly, on the UN Convention 
on the Law of the Sea, which provides a legal framework for ocean 
issues and, a basis for the management, conservation and utilization 
of the ocean area both within and beyond the Icelandic jurisdiction. 
Secondly, on the principle of sustainable development, the basis of 
which was established at the 1992 UN Conference on Environment an 
Development in Rio de Janeiro. Thirdly, on the principle that responsi-
bility for the conservation and utilization of marine ecosystem is best 
placed in the hands of those States directly affected by decisions taken 
and have the greatest interests at stake.

3. The public sector
Ministry of Fisheries
The Ministry of Fisheries is responsible for the conservation and utili-
zation of the living marine resouces, which encompasses the duty to 
respect and take into account environmental concerns.  It addresses 
these concerns through its policies and legislation as well as  through 
its commitment to the UNCLOS. The Ministry for Environment i.a. 
sees to concerns pertaining to the prevention of pollution of the ocean, 
matters pertaining to toxic and hazardous substances and conservation 
of biodiversity.

The Ministry is responsible for management of fisheries in Iceland, 
and the implementation of legislation, and issues regulations to this ef-
fect. The Ministry´s duties are general administration, long-term plan-
ning and relations with other fisheries institutions at the international 
level. Three bodies assist the Ministry of Fisheries in management 
and general administration tasks: Directorate of Fisheries, The Marine 
Research Institute and The Coast Guard.

Directorate of Fisheries 
The Directorate of Fisheries is an Icelandic Government institution 
under the ultimate responsibility of the Minister of Fisheries. The 
Directorate is responsible for implementing government policy on 
fisheries management and handling of seafood products. 

The Directorate enforces laws and regulations regarding fisheries man-
agement, monitoring of fishing activities and imposition of penalties 
for illegal catches. The Directorate allocates catch quotas and issues 
fishing permits to vessels. Furthermore, the Directorate is the compe-
tent authority responsible for the operation of border inspection posts. 

Collection, processing and publication of fisheries data is also the 
responsibility of the Directorate of Fisheries in collaboration with 
Statistics Iceland.

The Marine Research Institute
The Marine Research Institute (MRI) is a government institute under 
the auspices of the Ministry of Fisheries. MRI conducts various marine 
research and provides the Ministry with scientific advice based on its 
research on marine resources and the environment. The institute has 
around 170 employees, 2 research vessels, 5 branches around Iceland 
and a mariculture laboratory. 

The three main areas of activities of the MRI are the following: To 
conduct research on the marine environment around Iceland and its 
living resources, to provide advice to the government on catch levels 
and conservation measures and to inform the government, the fishery 
sector and the public about the sea and its living resources.

MRI’s avtivities are organized into three main sections: Environment 
Section, Resources Section and Advisory Section.

Marine Environment Section
A large part of the section´s work deals with environmental conditions 
(nutrients, temperature, salinity) in the sea, marine geology, and the 
ecology of algae, zooplankton, fish larvae, fish juveniles, and benthos. 
The available data on fishing effort of the Icelandic fleet is very ac-
curate and have made it possible to map in detail the distribution of 
otter trawl effort around Iceland. Priority have been given to map the 
distribution of benthic assemblages and habitats which are considered 
to be sensitive to trawling disturbances. Such information are impor-
tant in order to predict which species and habitats are being at risk of 
being damaged by fishing activites and for protection of important 
marine habitats. The closure of five vulnerable coral area are one of the 
results from this work. Amongst the larger projects undertaken within 
the Environmental Section are investigations on surface currents using 
satellite monitored drifters, assessment of primary productivity, over-
wintering and spring spawning of zooplankton, studies on spawning of 
the most important exploited fish stocks and seabed mapping. 

Marine Resources Section 
Investigations are undertaken on the exploited stocks of fish, crus-
taceans, mollusks and marine mammals. The major part of the work 
involves estimating stock sizes and the total allowable catch (TAC) 
for each stock.  Examples of some large projects within the Marine 
Resources Section are annual ground fish surveys covering the shelf 
area around Iceland and surveys for assessing inshore and deep-water 
shrimp, lobster, and scallop stocks. The pelagic stocks of capelin and 
herring are also monitored annually in extensive research surveys 
using acoustic methods. Further, in recent years an extensive program 
concentrating on multi-species interactions of exploited stocks in 
Icelandic waters has also been carried out. 

ICAS 
Attachment 3



55

The Fisheries Advisory Section
The Fisheries Advisory Section scrutinizes stock assessments and 
prepares the formal advice on TAC´s and sustainable fishing strategies 
for the government. 

The Coast Guard

The Iceland Coast Guard, which falls under the auspices of the Min-
istry of Justice, is responsible for patrol and monitoring in Iceland´s 
EEZ as well as on the high sea outside Iceland’s EEZ where Iceland 
has direct fishing interests such as in the NEAFC area. Additionally the 
Coast Guard inspects fishing gear noting whether it fulfills the require-
ment of regulations.

4. The fishing industry
The fishing industry is the mainstay of the national economy, however 
it does not receive any subsidies. The Icelandic fishing industry is quite 
competitive and has expanded its operation to other countries. It has a 
stake in the sustainable use of the marine resources.

The total Icelandic catches amount to 1.3 – 2 million tons annually. 
Figure 1 shows Icelandic fish catch for all major species in 1905-2006. 
The importance of the fishing industry peaked during the 20th century. 
The main reason for the increase in volume of the Icelandic fisheries, 
starting around 1970s, is the start of capelin fisheries and in recent 
years increased herring and blue whiting fisheries.

The fishing fleet consists of several vessel types. Officially they are 
divided into trawlers, decked vessels and undecked small vessels. Not 
all fishing vessels registered in Iceland are active but may lay idle, e.g. 

in 2005 only 1 449 vessels out of 1 752 registered were active. With 
the implementation of the ITQ (individual transferable quota) system, 
overcapacity in the fisheries was not an issue in itself anymore as it 
is up to the operator of the vessel to conduct the fisheries in its most 
efficient way.

The fisheries sector in Iceland provides over 50% of earnings of 
exported goods, making the annual market value of seafood around 2 
billion US dollars. Fisheries have and will continue to play a great role 
for the economic survival of the nation even though it’s share is reduc-
tive as other industries are growing fast. The most important market 
for Icelandic export of marine products is the European Economic 
Area amounting 70-80% of the total value with UK as the biggest sin-
gle market reaching over a quarter of the total export value of marine 
products in some years.

5. The fisheries management system in Iceland
The Fisheries Management Act from 1990 is the cornerstone of the 
current system of fisheries management in Icelandic waters. The Act 
aims at promoting the conservation and efficient utilisation of fish 
stocks, thereby ensuring stable employment and settlement throughout 
the country. The Act is intended to provide the principles for fisher-
ies management and to create a foundation for efficient, rational and 
sustainable utilisation of fish stocks, in order to provide maximum 
resource yield for the country as a whole. These targets thus fit in well 
with the concept and objectives of sustainable development.
The catch limitation system is the basis of the Icelandic fisheries man-
agement system. The system is intended to limit the total catch and to 
prevent more fishing from the fish stocks than the authorities allow at 
any given time. The catch limitation system is based on the catch share

allocated to individual vessels. Each vessel is allocated a certain share 
of the total allowable catch (TAC) of the relevant species. The catch 
limit of each vessel during the fishing year is thus determined on basis 
of the TAC of the relevant species and the vessel’s share in the total 
catch. The catch share may be divided and transferred to other vessels, 
with certain limitations. 

It was in 2004 the fisheries management system became a uniform 
quota system. The small vessels that were still in a system of fishing 
days were then issued a catch quota in accordance with their fishing 
permit. This final merging of the days at sea system and the quota sys-
tems resulted in a comprehensive system that ensures that fishing is in 
accordance with the decision of the Minister of Fisheries and supports 
sustainable utilisation of the natural resource. 

The management has three pillars, firstly the general individual trans-
ferable quota system (ITQ), secondly the small vessels ITQ, where 
there are restrictions on use of gear and selling of quota is limited to 
that part. Thirdly there are regional policy instruments, where a limited 
quantity of quotas are allocated to vessels in communities that are 
dependent on fisheries and have been adversely affected by national 
fluctuations or other shocks. Fishing vessels are allocated a fixed quota 
share of the species subject to TAC. The combined quota share for 
all vessels amounts to 100% of each species. All commercial fishing 
activities are subject to these quotas

In addition to the ITQ system which, together with the TAC alloca-
tion, is the cornerstone of Iceland’s fisheries management, there are a 
number of other measures that are integral to the overall management 
system. 

Deciding the total allowable catch (TAC) based on scientific 
grounds
 

The Minister of Fisheries is obliged by law to take recognition of the 
advice from the Marine Research Institute before determining the 
annual TAC. The Minister of Fisheries determines the annual TAC of 
every species subject to quota regulation. A scientific assessment of the 
state of the fish stocks and the condition of the ecosystem constitutes 
the main basis of determining the TAC each year. Conformity between 
the scientific fisheries advice and the authorities’ decisions on the TAC 
is a principal factor for ensuring responsible fisheries management. 
The authorities’ decisions on the maximum catch are based on social 
and economic factors, yet always focused on ensuring the long-term 
renewal of the fish stocks. For instance the Minister decided to cut 
down the TAC in cod in 2007 ca. 30% according to the advice of the 
MRI. The Icelandic authorities have implemented a utilization strategy 
with the long-term objective of ensuring sustainable fisheries.

The catch rule
There are different ways to implement a precautionary approach in 
fisheries. In 1995 Iceland adopted a catch rule for cod, and catch rules 
for capelin and herring had been adopted previously. The catch rule 
was a result of extensive work by marine biologists and economists 
who provided advice on maintaining stability in the fishing sector, the 
most favourable stock size and efficient rebuilding of the cod stock, 
among other things, taking into account the relationship between cod, 
capelin and shrimp stocks.

Figures 2 and 3 show the development in the management in cod and 
the capelin fisheries as well as catches from these fisheries during the 
period 1988-2006/7. Since 1995 the TAC in cod fisheries follows a 
catch control rule which allows for a certain percentage of the fishable 
stock to be fished. The rule has been amended couple of times and the 
percentage lowered to ensure the sustainability of the stock. 

As there is a strong connection between the cod and the capelin stock 
the management advice for capelin takes into consideration the need of 
the cod stock for capelin as fodder.

Effective catch control and enforcement
 

Effective control is an inseparable part of the responsible fisheries 
management and ensures that the catches in Iceland are well in con-
formity with the TAC every fishing year. The Directorate of Fisheries 
is responsible for the implementation of laws and regulations regarding 
fisheries management in Iceland and for monitoring and enforcement 
regarding the fisheries operation and the fish processing. All com-
mercial fisheries are subject to authorization by the Directorate of 
Fisheries. 

The fisheries inspectors of the Directorate of Fisheries monitor the 
correct weighing and registration of the catch. Information on each 
vessels allowable catch and quota use is regularly updated and made 
public and accessible to all on the Directorate’s web-site, as mandated 
by law, thus ensuring transparency. Any catch brought ashore is to be 
weighed by accredited harbour officials. Upon completion of weigh-
ing, the relevant harbour authorities register the catch in the central 
database of the Directorate of Fisheries, which ensures a steady over-
view of the status of the allowable catch of every vessel and how much 
has been taken from the fisheries quota. After the information about 
the catch has been entered into the database it is accessible to everyone 
on the Internet. This arrangement provides a great deal of transparency 
and ensures better control and inspection of the fishing and catch posi-
tion of Icelandic boats and vessels.

The fishing gear is subject to effective monitoring, as well as the com-
position of the catch and its handling onboard the fishing vessels. The

inspectors have access to the catch logs, which state the location of the 
fishing activity, the day of the catch, the type of fishing gear used and 
the catch quantity. If such control reveals the presence of much small 
fish or juveniles at the fishing grounds, the Marine Research Institute 
temporarily closes the relevant fishing grounds without delay. 

Reliability of catch information ensured 
The effectiveness of monitoring of the fisheries and catch control 
is reflected, among other things, in the observed good conformity 
between the TAC and the real catch every year. Anyone purchasing 
and/or selling catches is obligated to present reports to the Directorate 
of Fisheries, containing information on the purchase, sale and other 
disposition of fish catches. If discrepancy materializes in the database 
of the Directorate of Fisheries between the information stated in the 
reports and the information received from the harbour weighing, 
measures are taken when this is deemed appropriate. This ensures 
independent checking of the accuracy of information about the catches 
that are brought ashore. Experience shows that there is good conform-
ity between the catch information of the Directorate of Fisheries and 
the information about the total fish export as registered elsewhere. This 
conformity illustrates the reliability of the catch information. 

Severe penalty for breaches of the fisheries management 
legislation 
Breaches of the law and regulations on fisheries management are sub-
ject to fines or revoking of the fishing permit, irrespective of whether 
such conduct is by intent or negligence. Major or repeated intentional 
offenses are subject to up to six years imprisonment. If the catch of 
a vessel exceeds the allowable catch of the said vessel of individual 
species, the relevant fishing company must obtain an additional catch 
quota for the relevant species. If this is not done within a certain time-
frame, the fishing permit may be revoked as well as a charge having to 
be paid for the illegal catch.

Special measures for protecting small fish and the 
ecosystem 
In addition to the ITQ system which, together with the TAC (total 
allowable catch) allocation, is the cornerstone of Iceland’s fisheries 
management, the management system is supported by other manage-
ment measures such as closure of areas to protect juveniles, stringent 
restrictions on fishing gear, and use of protected areas to conserve 
important vulnerable habitats. The closures may apply to specific 
fishing gear, fishing-vessel size or all fishing for certain periods of 
time. Annually, such temporary closures of areas are in force to protect 
spawning grounds of cod and other demersal species. These closures 
aims at conserving certain biological resources, spawning grounds, 
juveniles or unwanted bycatches. 

The regulations concerning the type of fishing gear permitted, include 
the minimum mesh size, fishing with trawls is prohibited in large areas 
near the coast which serve as spawning and nursery areas. Grids in 
fishing gear are obligatory in certain fisheries to prevent catches of 
juvenile fish. 

Extensive provisions are made for temporary closures of fishing areas 
to protect spawning fish from all fishing. In addition, the Marine 
Research Institute (MRI) has the authority to close fishing areas tem-
porarily without prior notice if the proportion of small fish in the catch 
exceeds certain limits. If small fish or by-catch repeatedly exceeds 
guideline limits, the relevant area is closed for a longer period of time. 
Additionally, in some areas the use of bottom contact fishing gear is 
totally prohibited to protect vulnerable habitats, e.q. corals. In a 2005 
report on the protection of vulnerable marine areas, three areas south 
of Iceland in total 73 square kilometers were considered in need of 
a special protection and a need for further electronic mapping of the 
seabed identified. The fisheries sector was given the opportunity to 
comment or amend these proposals before the Minister decided upon 
them. In the process the protected areas were extended to cover some 
80 sq.km, including five coral reefs. A new regulation adressing espe-
cially vulnerable benthic habitats provides for prohibition of fishing 
activities with bottom contacting gears.

The closures of the coral reefs were done with acceptance of the fish-
ing industry. The gathering of information and definitions of areas to 
be closed or protected were work of cooperation between the main 
stakeholders, i.e. the fishing industry, authorities and the scientific 
authority.

Clear rules on discards and the disposition of by-catch
Collecting and bringing ashore any catches in the fishing gear of fish-
ing vessels is obligatory according to law.  Discarding catch overboard 
is prohibited and such conduct is subject to penalty according to law. If 
a vessel catches any species in excess of its fishing permit, the relevant 
fishing company has the option of obtaining additional quota within a 
certain period of time after landing the catch. 

A part of the criticism of the quota system has been that it creates 
incentives for fishermen to throw away valuable catch when they don’t 
own the necessary quotas.  As a response to this criticism the Icelandic 
Parliament decided that every operator could land up to 5% in excess 
of his annual catch quota (0.5% for pelagic species).  This excess catch 
must be registered and weighed separately, sold at an auction market 
and the proceeds go to a research fund that supports marine research. 

Another feature of the legislation that helps against discards is that the 
fishermen can land up to a certain limit small or undersize fish with 
only 50% of the weight being charged against the annual catch quota.

and fisheries for sapelin

The limit is generally 10% for each species in each landing.  The 
smaller fish is normally sold for a lower price so the fishermen don’t 
have the same incentive to throw it away.  

The Directorate of Fisheries and the Marine Research Institute conduct 
research and estimate discarded catches. The results indicate insignifi-
cant discards by the Icelandic fishing fleet. 

6. Ecosystem-based fisheries management in 
Iceland
Sustainable utilisation of resources is the key to a rational and respon-
sible conservation and management of living marine resources. The 
marine ecosystem are being examined by using a holistic approach, in 
order for Icelandic policy to include all aspects of marine life. 

In Iceland the Marine Research Institute carries out research on the 
ocean’s commercial stocks and provides the authorities with fisheries 
advice. The Marine Research Institute is an independent institution that 
falls under the auspices of the Ministry of Fisheries and is the main 
research body in Iceland conducting marine and fisheries research. 
Stock assessments are based on systematic research of the size and 
productivity of the fish stocks and the marine ecosystem. Additionally, 
the institute investigates fishing gear and its impact on the ecosystem, 
including bottom trawl, line, net and mid-water trawl fisheries and the 
fishing gear’s selectivity.  Research on the impact of fishing gear is 
among other things aimed at minimizing to the extent possible such 
impact on the ocean’s ecosystem. 

Active collaboration with international scientific organisations ensures 
that the focus is on internationally acknowledged research methods 
that provide the best available information on the condition of the fish 
stocks around Iceland at any time. Stock assessments and scientific 
fisheries advice are the main foundations of the decisions made by 
the authorities on the TACs each year. Prior to the Marine Research 
Institute’s advice on the total catch being published, the institute’s as-
sessment of the size and condition of the main fish stocks is presented 
to and evaluated by relevant committees of the International Council 
for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES). Additionally, there is collabora-
tion with other multi-national organizations, including NEAFC 
(Northeast Atlantic Fisheries Commission) and NAFO (Northwest 
Atlantic Fisheries Organization), when addressing stocks occurring 
beyond the Icelandic Exclusive Economic Zone.  

Management of the utilisation of living marine resources in in Icelan-
dic waters has to a significant extent reflected the elements comprising 
the ecosystem approach. Emphasis has been placed on research and 
harvesting advice having regard to the interaction and interconnec-
tions between different stocks and species in marine ecosystem. Many 
research activities in recent years have been directed towards a more 
holistic view such as bottom trawl surveys and other resource surveys 
that were initially targeted at certain important fish stocks but are now 
also valuable source of information on any related or non-tareted, 
often, non-commercial species. The governement of Iceland has pub-
lished an official policy document on ocean matters with ecosystem 
approach to fisheries as part of the portfolio.

In Reykjavík an international conference on responsible fisheries in 
the marine ecosystem was held in the year 2001. The conference was 
held in preparation for the Johannesburg Summit on Sustainable De-
velopment. The Conference was held by FAO at the invitation of the 
Icelandic government and with support of the Norwegian government. 
The Conference was a major player in introducing the content and 
concept of an ecosystem approach into fisheries management. This ap-
proach implies that utilisation of marine resources should be managed 
from a wider perspective than that of simply considering commercial 
fish stocks. The Conference resulted in the Reykjavík Declaration on 
Responsible Fisheries in the Marine Ecosystem. The declaration was 
introduced and discussed at the Johannesburg Summit.

At the scientific symposium held in conjunction with the Reykjavík 
meeting it was concluded that many of the measures that are being 
implemented under single-species management shemes are in the spirit 
of ecosystem approach. As experience and circumstances allowed, 
improvement should be made on the existing methods in a stepwise 

process. Since then a the process has been good, but to determine 
objectives, criteria and appropriate/relevant indicators is complicated, 
and in general the matter is still at a design or development stage. 
While this development has taken place, many countries have contin-
ued to elaborate on single-species approach with standard ingredients 
such as those that have been developed and improved in Iceland and 
elsewhere in recent years. These comprise TAC´s to limit total fish 
removals, fishing gear, spatial/temporal restrictions, restrictions on 
vessel sizes, selective mesh size and gear, season length and timing, 
multispecies interactions and area closures, short or long-term. All 
these elements are essential and in the spirit of ecosystem approach to 
fisheries. 

By weighing one resource against another authorities and stakehold-
ers in Iceland have, with help of harvest control rule, managed the 
economically valuable cod stock, that feeds on capelin and shrimp. 
Every year sufficient quantity of capelin is left as fodder for the cod 
and sufficient quantity is left of capelin to spawn. Due to the close de-
pendence of capelin as food for cod, short-term predicitions for cod are 
significantly linked to predictions of the development of capelin stock 
in the following year. And since cod is valuable in economic terms, the 
long-term strategy was to build up the cod stock at the cost of lower 
shrimp yields. Likewise, in terms of biomass, whales constitute a 
major component of marine life in Icelandic waters and may signifi-
cantly influence the yield of the interacting fish stocks, different views 
arise as to how to value and manage the whale stocks. Weighing of 
components provides in this case like the other a basis for longer term 
management strategies. 

A well founded framework of ecosystem approach to fisheries is an 
appropriate tool to weigh these resources and take a well balanced 
management action with predicted consequences.

A pragmatic approach is under development at the MRI, to be applied 
in the current single stock fish assessments. For each species and a 
stock that is assessed, the aim is to map relevant information both for 
research and management purposes:

1.  The quality and nature of the assessment techniques used.
 The quality of the data. Stocks may be assessed with the help of  
 age-based techniques and managed on the basis of a well defined  
 long-term management strategy, they may be assessed with 
 age-based techniques or length-based techniques and catch data,  
 and managed on ad hoc basis. In data poor situations, one would  
 normally require special caution and notation of this would be  
 relevant in this context.

2. The effects of the given fishery on the target stock. 

 i) Further, the effects of the fishery in question with respect to dis 
 cards of target and non-target species by gear and area will be  
 mapped. Indirect mortalities of target and non-target species would  
 be examined. An assumed level of impact would be noted, 
 availability of estimates and monitoring series, and whether there is  
 a specific need for actions to be taken.

 ii) The potential effects of the fishery in question on the physical 
 environment by area, e.g. fish and benthic habitats (spawning  
 grounds, nursery grounds and coldwater corals).

 iii) The potential effects of the fishery in question on different  
 ecosystem components or species/stock complexes. This includes  
 examination of benthic and zooplankton communities, sea birds,  
 marine mammals and fish communities. Examination of whether  
 the exploitation of the target species affects the livelihood of other  
 biological resources, e.g. due to lesser predation or competition.  
 e,g. fish and benthic habitats (spawning grounds, nursery grounds  
 and coldwater corals).

Several other factors have to be taken account of in this appraoch 
which can be  applied for each species caught in a single-species 
management scheme.

 3. Relevant, multispecies considerations will be noted. Availability  
 of food-web data and modelling.

ICAS

 4. A special attention will be given to potential effects of 
 enviromental changes on the target stock in question, since the  
 concern is not only on the human activities on the ecosystem. 

 5. A routinely considerations for some special management, where  
 they may seem needed. Operational factors have to be noted and  
 taken account of, e.g. change in markets or technological shift in  
 the fisheries. Change in the distribution of stocks.

All these additional ecosystem considerations would cast light on 
aspects that are relevant for ecosystem approach to fisheries. This 
would be reflected in the assessment work itself, and in future plans of 
investigations. In addition to conventional advice to authorities on
recommended TAC´s, a qualitative statement on important or relevant 
issues in ecosystem context would follow, that would put the advice 
into a wider ecosystem approach to fisheries context than conventional 
advice.

By taking account of the circumstances in the waters around Iceland 
the Marine Research Institute is step by step adding important compo-
nents to the already functioning single-species scheme and by doing 
that improving and building up an ecosystem approach to fisheries.
The framework for fisheries management is gradually being adapted 
to fit the objectives of the ecosystem approach that is being built in 
step by step in the assessment scheme that is aready being used. This 
framework is built on a national priorities that can be diverse in objec-
tives from other national or regional frameworks, taking account of 
different circumstances.

An important objective and implementation strategy of an ecosystem 
approach is that it must be developed in consultation between govern-
ments, scientists and stakeholders. The cooperation between scientists 
and the industry has long history in iceland as part of the fishing fleet 
has been involved in scientific work every year for decades. The 
examples above on multispecies management system, the relation-

ship between cod, capelin and shrimp and the influence of whales are 
cases worth referring to when discussing EAF. In this cases scientist 
and fishing industry have been heavily involved.  The closure of five 
vulnerable marine habitats (coldwater corals) was developed in good 
cooperation with stakeholders. In the scientific work of location, fish-
ermen supplied valuable information on locations of coldwater corals 
which led to the above mentioned closure of five areas. The closure 
was done with acceptance of the industry.

Ecosystem approach to fisheries is based on existing management 
practices, knowledge and structure, it uses the principles and instru-
ments of conventional fisheries management and develops them to 
further incorporate ecosystem consideration. Increased scientific 
knowledge is the fundamental tool for continual development of the 
ecosystem approach to fisheries. Ecosystem approach is therefore an 
adaptive process. At the MRI the development of a practical applica-
tions of the ecosystem approach to fisheries is in work. By maintaining 
the current emphases and objectives, increased knowledge are being 
used to improve resource management methods step by step. A broad-
ened single-species considerations may provide a pragmatic approach 
to move stepwise forward in this respect.

7. International agreements and regional 
co-operation
The main share of Icelandic catches are fished inside the Icelandic 
EEZ from stocks that are solely managed by Icelandic authorities, e.g. 
almost all cod processed and exported from Iceland is fished according 
to the Icelandic management system. Several stocks are joint stocks 
managed by Iceland in co-operation with other nations, as they occure 
both inside and outside Icelandic EEZ. Fishing from joint stocks are 
managed either by bilateral agreements beetween states or multilat-
eral agreements often performed in the regional fisheries managment 
organizations.

ICAS 
Attachment 3



60

The United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement (UNFSA) is the basis for 
international fisheries management and for conservation of straddling 
and highly migratory fish stocks. Iceland regards the UNFSA as of a 
paramount importance, as it strengtherns considerably the framework 
for conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly 
migratory fish stocks by regional fisheries management organizations 
(RFMOs). The RFMOs are highly relevant for co-operation between 
coastal states and high seas fishing states as well are other regional 
arrangements for the conservation and management of fishing from 
such stocks. It is intended to ensure their long-term conservation and 
sustainable utilisation.

It is the view of Icelandic authorities that competent regional organi-
zations are the preferable forum to solve a management issues when 
several states utilize a common resource. 

Iceland is a party to various of regional arrangents on fisheries man-
agement in the North Atlantic, including Northeast Atlantic Fisheries 
Commission (NEAFC) and Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization 
(NAFO). In both these RFMOs a holistic view is taken to the utiliza-
tion of the marine resources in the high sea. 

Iceland has emphazised the role of the Food and Agricultural of the 
United nations (FAO) in the field of fisheries. Iceland has been actively 
taken part in the development of guidelines for deep-sea fisheries in 
the high seas and made financial contribution to this important work 
of FAO. Furthermore, Iceland has put effort in the work of COFI of 
effective measures against vessels enganged in IUU fishing on the high 
seas.

8. Steady improvements 
Fisheries management in Iceland has a long history and the fisheries 
management system has been under development for decades with a 
focus on the fisheries being both economical and sustainable with re-
spect to the natural resources’ utilization and renewal. In recent years, 
measures have been taken in strengthening an ecosystem approach to 
the fisheries management in Iceland. Increasing emphasis is placed 
on research and development of methods in this field, and on fisheries 
advice that takes into account various interrelated factors in the eco-
system, such as the interaction of the species, environmental change 
and multi-species impacts. The focus is furthermore on strengthening 
research on the effects of fishing gear on the ecosystem, particularly on 
the seabed and the living bottom communities. 

Icelanders have the ambition to be in the forefront of responsible 
treatment of the natural resources of the ocean. Hence, steady im-
provements are made of the fisheries management in Iceland and its 
scientific basis and measures are taken to strengthen the dissemination 
of information on the Icelandic fisheries.

Summary
In Greenland elements of ecosystem-based ocean management have 
been introduced, but an integrated ecosystem-based ocean manage-
ment is still to be developed. Practices in management of fisheries and 
hunting, sea traffic, mineral resources, and nature conservation are 
predominantly management by single species or single activities with 
elements of stakeholder involvement. 

The important success element in moving towards integrated ecosys-
tem-based ocean management is the achievement of sustainable use of 
natural resources. 

Currently, the main obstacle is the lack of a national strategy for the 
use of ecosystem-based management, including a strategy for nature 
conservation and species management in Greenland. There is a need 
to develop desired aims for nature conservation and species manage-
ment in line with international conventions and national policies. 
Furthermore, strategies on monitoring and stakeholder involvement, 
and guidelines on ecosystem-based management in relevant sectors are 
to be developed. 

8.1 Greenland and the marine ecosystems
Greenland covers an area of 2.166.086 km2 and more than 80 per cent 
of the island is covered by the Greenland Ice Sheet. The northernmost 
point is Cape Morris Jesup, only 740 km from the North Pole, while 
Cape Farewell in the south shares latitude with Oslo, Norway.

Atlantic and Arctic waters surround the island of Greenland. To the 
south Greenland meets the North Atlantic Ocean and to the east the 
Greenland Sea and the 240 km wide Denmark Strait between Green-
land and Iceland. The west coast of Greenland meets the Davis Strait 
and Baffin Bay, and north of Qaanaaq Smith Sound and Nares Strait, 
waters that separates Greenland from Ellesmere Island, Canada. In 
Nares Strait a mere 26 kilometres separate Greenland from Canada. 
North of Greenland lays Lincoln Sea and Wandels Sea, both within the 
Arctic Ocean.  

The Greenland coastal line covers 44.087 km. The coast is dominated 
by deep fiords and archipelagos, and conditions for marine activities 
can be challenging as icebergs, sea ice and storms are common.

Climate and the effects of climate change
In the Arctic region the low temperature is the greatest challenge fac-
ing organisms. Climatic conditions define the physical framework for 
the existence of life in an area. 

The high arctic zone, with average temperature during the warmest 
months of the year below 5°C, covers the entire Greenland Ice Sheet 
and the costal region of northern Greenland. The high arctic zone 
borders with the towns of Upernavik and Uummannaq on the west 
coast and Ittoqqortoormiit on the east coast of Greenland. But inland 
the high arctic zone reaches as far south as 61°N. 

The low arctic zone, with average temperatures during the warmest 
months of the year between 5°C and 10°C, covers the coastal areas on 
both the east and west coast from Cape Farewell to 72°N. The open 
sea area in the south brings relatively cool summers and mild winters 
to this area. In the valleys of the deep fiords the average temperature 
may climb above 10°C in the summer categorizing these as small and 
isolated areas with a subarctic climate.

Travelling north the average rain fall decreases dramatically. In South 
Greenland the annual average rain fall is 800 to 1400 mm while north-
ern regions and the Greenland Ice Sheet only receive 200 mm. The 
Peary Land area in northern Greenland can be categorized as an arctic 
desert with virtually no rainfall. 

Changes in climate are fast and dramatic in the Arctic. The Arctic 
Climate Impact Assessment (2004) forecasts increases in average 
temperatures by 2°C in the low arctic areas of South Greenland over 
the next century, and along with an increase in rainfall the lengthened 
growing season will bring a more vigorous plan cover. In North Green-
land the average winter temperature will increase by 6 - 10°C, but 
dramatic changes in the average summer temperature are not expected. 

According to the ACIA report Greenland will see an increase in rain- 
and snowfall by 10 to 50 per cent. 

In Greenland the effects of climate change are visible and have there-
fore received attention in the international climate debate. Warmer 
winter presents a challenge to traditional ways of life as unstable ice 
conditions makes it difficult for hunters and fishermen to perform 
traditional ice fishing and hunting. As new waters open the dog sledge 
may be replaced by boat covering larger hunting grounds. 

The changes in temperature will affect the wildlife in Greenland. The 
northeast population of musk ox (Ovibos moschatus) and caribou 
(Rangifer tarandus) might be threatened by the climatic changes, 
while the population in South Greenland is likely to prosper from a 
more vigorous vegetation cover. Researchers expect the population of 
polar bear (Ursus maritimus) in Northeast Greenland to be challenged 
by the climatic changes. 

Melting permafrost is a future challenge to infrastructural planning 
and development. Asiaq/ Greenland Survey participates in a project 
surveying the melting of the permafrost in Alaska and on 6 locations 
in West Greenland. Based on climate models the researchers hope to 
predict the extent of melting permafrost in 2050. Generally, housing is 
based on bedrock, but the melting permafrost is a challenge infrastruc-
ture, i.e. roads, runways and sewage systems. 

However, the effects of climate change also bring new opportunities 
to the Greenlandic society. Retreating ice is exposing ancient bedrock 
enriched with minerals, including diamonds, olivine and zinc, and 
Greenland is experiencing an increase in mineral exploration activi-
ties. The economy largely depends on fisheries and tourism, but new 
industries are developing with the mineral activities and the plans for 
an aluminium smelter on the island of Maniitsoq. In South Greenland 
agriculture is developing as more vegetables can be grown and in 
the future small scale forestry might develop and current livestock of 
sheep might be supplemented by cattle. 

The international focus on climate change in the Arctic has also 
brought an increased number of tourists. But the fishing industry is still 
predominant in the economy of Greenland. Changes in stocks calls for 
a re-orientation of the industry as northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis) 
has started to disappear from the waters off South Greenland, while 
large stocks of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) are reappearing. 

8.2 Marine ecosystems and marine protected areas
The marine ecosystems in Greenland are characterized by seasonal ice 
cover and marked fluctuations in temperature and light. In parts of the 
region ice cover occurs seasonally, the ice and ice melt have large in-
fluence on ecological conditions. When the ice melts, there is typically 
a sudden increase in light and a burst of plant growth in the form of an 
ice edge bloom in spring and summer. This supports large populations 
of fish, marine mammals and birds.

Another typical feature of the marine Arctic is the way in which sea 
ice, melt water and ice scours physically affect bottom plants and ani-
mals on or near the coast. Iceberg scour can cause damage to bottom 
fauna to depths of 500 meters. Sea ice limits the penetration of light 
into the ocean, but also curtails the ability of wind to stir up the water. 
The changes in seasons with freezing and thawing of the ice have pro-
found effects on the hydrographic conditions in the uppermost 50 to 
200 meters of the water column and therefore on primary production. 
In spring a fresh surface layer is formed and augmented by freshwater 
runoff from rivers and streams. Especially near the coastline a thick 
layer of fresh water can form, driving away fish.

8.2.1 Large Marine Ecosystems in Greenland
The data presented in the section below is based on research and 
information made available by the Sea around Us project, based at 
the University of British Colombia and the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and on recent LME studies as 
published in an article on the West Greenland Shelf LME and the East 
Greenland Shelf LME respectively, published by researchers Aquarone 
and Adams on the LME portal of the NOAA in the autumn of 2008.

Greenland waters cover two Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs); the 
West Greenland Shelf LME (LME no. 18) and the East Greenland 
Shelf LME (LME no. 19). Both LMEs are considered Class III low 
productivity ecosystems (< 150 gC/m2-yr) based on primary produc-
tivity estimates from SeaWiFS.

The West Greenland Shelf LME (see Fig. 1) begins 
at Eirik Ridge in Southern Greenland and extends 
along Greenland’s west coast. This LME covers 
area of 375.000 km2 of which 1.37 per cent is 
protected. The LME is characterized by its subar-
ctic climate as well as by ice cover in the winter. 
Greenland shares jurisdiction of the West Greenland 
Shelf LME with Canada. 

The West Greenland Shelf LME is closely con-
nected with the East Greenland Shelf LME. The 
strong Irminger current of the Greenland Sea carries 
water down the Greenland east coast and around the 
southernmost Cape Farewell.  

The East Greenland Shelf LME extends along 
Greenland’s east coast to the Eirik Ridge, covering 
an area of approximately 319.000 km2, of which 
some 13 per cent is protected. The continental shelf 
varies in width from 750 km in the north to a mere 
75 km in the south, and the costal line is dominated 
by a large number of fiords. 

This LME is influenced by the cold East Greenland 
current, which flows south along the coast from the 
polar sea area. The LME is characterized by sub-
arctic climate, seasonal ice cover and marked fluc-
tuations in salinity, temperature and phytoplankton. 

A low productivity ecosystem, changes in both sea 
and air temperature is principal physical driving 
force of the East Greenland Shelf LME. These 
climatic variations cause large variability in ice and 
hydrographic conditions within a year. Therefore 
plankton production and fish recruitment is affected 
and brings variations in annual catches of cod and 
small pelagic fish. 

In the summer the melting of the ice has significant 
effects on ecological conditions, causing large 
amounts of nutrient salts to be transported into 
the waters around East Greenland. Owing to these 
climatic factors and to the high latitude of this LME 
the seasonal phytoplankton production is of short 
duration and of limited extent. Primary production 
is conveyed efficiently to higher tropic levels and 
supports large populations of fish, marine mammals 
and seabirds. 

There is a relatively long time series of plankton 
and hydrographic samples allowing an exploration 
of the links between climate, physical oceano-
graphy and abundance of major zooplankton and 
ichtyoplankton species. 

Currents carry cod eggs and larvae around Cape 
Farwell in southern Greenland, as seen in the influx 
of cod larvae from Iceland in 2001. There is a need 
to learn more about the patterns of occurrence of 
fish larvae and zooplankton over time and space. 
As part of the monitoring programme NuukBasic, 
managed by the Centre of Marine Ecology and 
Climate Effects at the Greenland Institute of Natu-
ral Resources, studies on selected fish larvae and 
zooplankton in relation to hydrographic features are 
undertaken. 

The Health of the LMEs
 The waters of the West Greenland Shelf LME are 
little polluted according to Aquarone and Adams 
(2008). The population density is generally low and 
strong currents rapidly remove all waste. No waste 
water treatment plants are established in Greenland 
and solid waste is either burned in incineration 
facilities or depositioned at the open refuse dumps.

Localized elevated levels of lead and zinc have been found in sedi-
ments and biota near the Maarmorilik mining area near Uummannaq. 

Owing to the remoteness and the low population density, the environ-
mental conditions within the East Greenland Shelf LME are generally 
good

Studies indicate that the cold Arctic climate creates a sink for mercury 
and Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs), and that the already high 
levels of mercury in the Arctic are not declining despite emission 
reductions in Europe and North America. Around eastern Greenland 
levels of some Persistent Organic Pollutants (PCB and DDT) are rela-
tively high in both biotic and abiotic media. 

Studies under the Arctic Monitoring and Assessment Programme 
(AMAP) of the Arctic Council prove that levels of certain heavy 
metals and POPs are relatively high in a number of marine mammals 
living in Greenland waters, i.e. ringed seal (Phoca hispida), harp seal 
(Phoca groenlandica), minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), 
beluga whale (Delphinapterus leucas) and narwhale (Monodon 
monoceros). Mercury and cadmium can be found in the intestines 
of these mammals, and the POPs bio-accumulate in both human and 
animal tissue. The National Environmental Research Institute studies 
the polar bears and special attention has been drawn to the health of 
the East Greenland population of bears as the animals here have the 
highest levels of POPs. 

Studies of marine pollution and the effects on human 
health are also conducted as traditional Greenlandic 
food is rich on fish, seal and other marine mammals. 
Studies of human health prove that there is a great 
variation in the concentration of pollutants in human 
blood in Greenland, and generally the population liv-
ing off the sea show high concentrations of both DDT 
and PCB. 

The variations in DDT and PCB levels are explained 
by a number of factors. Researchers see increased lev-
els of POPs in marine mammals in the waters of East 
Greenland compared to the waters of West Greenland. 
But the researchers also find important differences in 
lifestyles in the towns of Southwest Greenland com-
pared to the small towns and settlements in Northeast 
and Northwest Greenland. Traditionally, meat from 
polar bear has been part of the East Greenland diet, 
whereas the north-western diet includes more whale. 

Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems
The knowledge about the existence of Vulnerable 
Marine Ecosystems (VME’s) is very limited. Organ-
isms, e.g. Gorgonian corals, have been found on both 
the West and East coast. The distribution of 

accumulations of large sized sponges is patchy and the presence 
depends to a great extent on the local topography. Some sponge fields, 
also known as ostur, are known from the east coast (Klitgaard and 
Tendal 2004).

Through their presence, species like corals and sponges increase the 
physical heterogeneity of the bottom and the associated fauna is very 
rich. Intensive trawling rapidly leads to severe depletion of these 
features. VME’s are at present not considered when designating areas 
closed to trawling.

“VME features may be physically or functionally fragile. The most 
vulnerable ecosystems are those that are both easily disturbed and 
very slow to recover, or may never recover”

8.2.2 Marine Protected Areas
Greenland and Denmark jointly participates in international forums 
where discussions, works and agreements may influence Greenlandic 
public affairs. 

Greenland has ratified a series of international conventions on protec-
tion of wildlife, flora and fauna, e.g. the Convention on Wetlands 
(RAMSAR), the Convention on International Trade on Endangered 
Species of wild flora and fauna (CITES), and the Convention on 
Biological Diversity (CBD). To help ensure mechanisms for protecting  
the environment and the marine environment the following conven-
tions have been ratified: the London convention on prevention of 
marine pollution by dumping wastes, the MARPOL convention for the 
prevention of pollution from ships (excluding annex 4 on wastewa-
ter from ships and annex 6 on emissions), the OSPAR convention 
for the protection of the maritime area against the adverse effects of 
human activities, the Basel convention on transboundary movements 
of hazardous wastes and their disposal, the Espoo convention on the 
assessment of impacts on the environment in a transboundary context 
(excluding the protocol on strategic environmental assessments), and 
the Climate convention and the Kyoto protocol on reduction of green-
house gas emissions.

 introduced: Lyngmarken (1954/1986), the National Park of North

Besides protected areas, protected wetlands there are thirteen bird 
protection areas listed in the Home Rule Government Order no. 5 of 29 
February 2008 on the Conservation of Birds. In these areas activities 
are regulated to protect birds in important areas for resting, breeding, 
moulting etc. General regulation of activities near cliffs and islands 
important to populations of birds apply nationally.

In ecosystem-based oceans management attention must be brought 
to the following protected areas that include marine habitats: The 
National Park of North and East Greenland, the Ilulissat Ice Fiord, the 
Melville Bay, the Ikka Fiord, and the Kitsissunnguit Islands. 
The National Park of North and East Greenland

The National Park was laid out in 1974 by the Danish Parliament on 
recommendation of the former Greenland National Council. In 1988 
the National Park was extended westwards and today it covers 972.000 
km2. The southernmost point of the National Park is located at 71°N 
in Scoresby Sound Fiord, while the northernmost point on the island of 
Odaaq is at 84°N. The National Park today borders on the traditional 
hunting communities of Ittoqqortoormiit on the east coast and Qaanaaq 
in northwest Greenland. 

Towards the Arctic Ocean and the Greenland Sea the borders run three 
nautical miles off the baseline, i.e. the line connecting the extreme 
points of the coast. 

The International Court of Justice in 1933 recognized Danish sover-
eignty and more importantly, recognized that Greenland is one society 
united by culture and language. Based on the ruling of the Internatio-
nal Court of Justice, the Second World War and thereafter the Cold 
War, the Danish Defence has patrolled the uninhabited areas of 
northern and eastern Greenland. During the war patrols travelling 

by dog sledges managed to localize German 
weather stations, and since 1952 the Sirius 
Patrol of the Danish Defence has patrolled the 
National Park area. From a base in Daneborg 
a patrol of 12 men travels the entire coastline 
each year.  

Stations used by the Ministry of Defence are 
placed along the National Park coast: Station 
Nord, Daneborg, Mestersvig, Ella Ø, Danmark-
shavn, Kap Moltke and Brøndlund Hus. 

In locations within the National Park there 
are a number of research facilities, e.g. the 
Zackenberg Research Station, which is an 
ecosystem research and monitoring facility 
north of Daneborg in East Greenland, and the 
US Summit Station, home of the Greenland 
Environmental Observatory. In 2008 a new 
series of ice core drillings began at the NEEM 
Station on the Greenland Ice Sheet just off the 
National Park border.  

The National Park of North and East Green-
land is a Managed Resource Protected Area 

in accordance with International Union for Conservation of Nature 
(IUCN) guidelines for protected area management. The National Park 
is covered by the UNESCO Man and the Biosphere Programme. 

The Home Rule Government has issued the Home Rule Government 
Order no. 7 of 17 June 1992 on the National Park of North and East 
Greenland, with later amendments. The aim of the order is to ensure 
eco-system conservation, i.e. protecting landscapes, geology, sites of 
historical or cultural value, and flora and fauna, and to regulate 
recreational use of the National Park. 

The Ilulissat Ice Fiord
The Ilulissat Ice Fiord is the sea mouth of Sermeq Kujalleq, one of 
the few glaciers through which the Greenland Ice Sheet reaches the 
sea. Sermeq Kujalleq is one of the most active glaciers in the world 
and it calves large volumes of ice annually. On an average the Sermeq 
Kujalleq calves over 35 km3 of ice annually, but large variations apply. 

Protected areas
Measures are taken to protect areas both in land and within the 3 nauti-
cal mile sea territory where they are of considerable natural, cultural or 
historic value.

The status on protected areas in 2008:
 11 protected areas (Nature Conservation Act) 
 11 RAMSAR sites (RAMSAR convention)
 13 bird protection areas (Government order on the Conservation 
 of Birds)

In eleven areas the Home Rule Government has enforced conservation 
in accordance with chapter 5 of the Nature Conservation Act, no. 29 of 
18 December 20031, while other eleven areas have been designated as 
protected wetlands in accordance with the RAMSAR convention
These areas have international ecological significance and special be 
taken in protection.

Being an object for scientific attention for 250 years, the Sermeq 
Kujalleq glacier has helped to develop our understanding of Ice Sheet 
glaciology and climate change. The illustration below (Fig. 5) marks 
the retraction of the glacier edge since 1850. 

The Melville Bay
 

The Melville Bay borders with the coast of Northwest Greenland, 
opening to the south-west into Baffin Bay. 

Home Rule Government Order no. 21 of 17 May 1989 on the nature 
reserve in Melville Bay, protects the coast and waters of Melville 
Bay. The border of the nature reserve covers the area between 76° 22’ 
30’’N / 64° 01’ 00’’W and 75° 40’ 30’’N / 57° 56’ 00’’W, but within 
the nature reserve of Melville Bay an area is laid out as fully protected 
(zone II).

The Ikka Fiord
 

Home Rule Government Order no. 11 of 25 April 2000 on the conser-
vation of the inner waters of the Ikka Fiord, protects the waters of the 
fiord and the remarkable submarine columns formed from ikaite found 
growing on the bed of the Ikka Fiord. Early research indicates that the 
water leaking from the columns is meteoric in origin and shows signs 
of enrichment in the chemicals necessary for ikaite formation during 
its passage through the Grønnedal Ika complex.

The protected area covers the inner parts of the fiord, from 61°11’N. 
The public has access to the ikaite columns, but only if measures are 
taken to protect the columns and the ecosystem. Sailing is permit-

ted if slow and in a boat with narrow drought, but within 50 m of the 
columns only kayaks and the like can be used. 

The Kitsissunnguit Islands
In April 2008 the Home Rule Government issued Order no. 11 of 17 
April 2008 on the Conservation of the Kitsissunnguit Islands.  

The Kitsissunnguit Islands in the Disko Bay region was designated 
as a RAMSAR site (site no. 388) in 1988 and the order was issued to 
promote the protection of the ecosystem and the biodiversity of the 
islands, in particular the important colony of Arctic tern. 

The Institute for Natural Resources in Nuuk and the National Environ-
mental Research Institute have monitored the population of Arctic tern 
during the last 6 years. The population of Arctic tern on the Kitsis-
sunnguit Islands is important and relatively large, covering approxi-
mately one-third of the total population in Greenland. Furthermore, the 
Kitsissunnguit population is well documented as it has been studied 
for decades. In 1946 the population was assessed at 50.000 pairs, but 
today only 18.000 pairs of Arctic tern inhabit the islands. In 2002 re-
searchers found that many chickens died or was weakened by the lack 
of food, while collection of eggs still took place despite regulations 
to protect birds. Based on this information and a long process of local 
stakeholder involvement the conservation of the Kitsissunnguit Islands 
was introduced in 2008. 

8.3 Commercial and non-commercial marine activities 
A wide range of activities may influence the marine environment. 
Below attention is drawn to activities within the fisheries and hunting,

mineral resources activities, the transportation of goods and passengers 
at sea, cruise tourism and finally non-commercial activities with an 
influence on the marine environment. Regulation and management of 
these activities will be addressed in sections 8.5.1 - 8.5.6.

8.3.1 Fisheries
The fishing industry has immense importance to Greenland’s economy. 
In 2000 the export of fish and fishing produce made up 95 per cent 
of the total value of export. Since 2000 the total value of export has 
increased, leaving the value of export of fish to drop to less than 90 per 
cent of the total value of export. Employment in the fishing industry is 
made up by some 2.000 individuals employed with fishing and 3.500 
in processing and distribution. 
 
Over the last century the industry has seen important changes as stocks 
of the most important fish species have fluctuated, as illustrated in 
figures 6 and 7. The most important commercial species are northern 
shrimp (Pandalus borealis), Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hip-
poglossoides), Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), northern crab (Chio-
noecetes opilio), lumpfish (Cyclopterus lumpus) scallop (Chlamys 
islandica), redfish (Sebastes mentella and Sebastes marinus), and 
capelin (Mallotus villosus). 

The Stock-Catch Status Plots, as presented by Aquarone and Adams, 
indicate that more than 70 per cent of commercially exploited stocks in 
the West Greenland Shelf LME have collapsed (Fig. 6, top). However, 
with 90 per cent of the landings still from fully exploited stocks, spe-
cifically from the northern shrimp (Fig. 6, bottom). 

Reported landings of commercial fish species show dramatic changes 
as the importance of Atlantic cod, which dominated the fisheries from 
1950 to 1970, has been replaced by the landings of northern shrimp. 
Today northern shrimp represents more than two-thirds of the reported 
total catches. 

In the 1960s Atlantic cod was the most important fish species in Green-
land and annual catches peaked at levels between 400.000 and 500.000 
tons in the 1960s. Since then the cod fishing industry has collapsed 
and according to NOAA low recruitment played an important role in 
this. While the catches of Atlantic cod declined, however, catches of 
Greenland halibut and northern shrimp increased.

The periodic fluctuations of cod stocks have been linked to changes 
in both sea and air temperature. According to Aquarone and Adams a 

long-term warming of the West Greenland Shelf LME was interrupted 
by cold events that peaked in 1970, 1983-84 and again in 1996. The 
decline in cod stocks coincide with cool periods while warmer periods 
are paralleled by higher stocks. Overfishing and its effects on stock 
size and stock interactions appear to coincide with climatically-driven 
variability (Aquarone et al.). Scientists have hypothesised both that 
variation in larval and juvenile drift to recruitment variability in the 
West Greenland waters (Buch et al., 1994, Pedersen, 1994), while 
others find that the present abundance of northern shrimp in the West 
Greenland Shelf LME may partly be a result of a lower abundance of 
Atlantic cod and redfish (Horsted 1989). According to a third hypoth-
esis the large by-catch of redfish, Greenland halibut, Atlantic cod and 
others were caught and discarded in the shrimp fishery of this LME 
(Pedersen and Kanneworff, 1995). 

Introduction of the sorting grid in the shrimp fishery in 2000 limited 
the bycatch drastically. The shrimp fishery is a relatively clean fishery 
today and bycatch must be reported in the logbook by kilo. Some ves-
sels in the inshore shrimp fishery are still exempt from the sorting grid.

Greenland halibut is mainly fished in the northern fjords, parts of the 
fishery is small scale dinghy fishery. Greenland halibut is fished from 
the ice using dog sledges or snowmobiles in northern Greenland. 
Northern crab is fished by a few large vessels and numerous smaller 
ones. The fishery peaked in 2002 and has declined sharply since then. 
 
According to The Sea around Us project (2007) Greenland accounts 
for the largest share of the ecological footprint in the West Greenland 
Shelf LME, although a number of European countries accounted for 
the majority of the footprint in the 1950s and 1960s, where large Euro-
pean fleets fished Greenlandic waters. 

Annual landings off the East Greenland coast have seen even more 
dramatic fluctuations.  Reported landings have fluctuated from a low 
of 11.000 tonnes in 1983 to a high of 225.000 tonnes in 1996. Until the 
early 1970s the reported landings were dominated by cod (with a small 
peak again in the 1990s) until the collapse of the stock. Today the com-
mercially fished species are mainly shrimp, capelin and redfish.

The stock-Catch Status Plots indicate a high proportion of collapsed 
stocks in this LME (Fig. 7, top), and a high contribution of these 
stocks to the reported landings biomass (Fig. 7, bottom). The jagged 
appearance of the latter plot reflects fluctuations in the reported 
landings.

Greenland Shelf LME; showing the proportion 
of developing (green), fully exploited (yellow), 
overexploited (orange) and collapsed (purple) 
fisheries by number of stocks (top) and by catch 
biomass (bottom) from 1950 to 2004. Note that 
(n), the number of “stocks”, i.e.., individual land-
ings time series, only include taxonomic entities

Projections suggest that climate change over the next century is likely 
to benefit the most valuable fish stocks at Greenland. This is particu-
larly likely to be the case for the stock of Atlantic cod, which is likely 
to experience a revival to a level, seen during the warm periods of 
the 20th century, where it could yield up to 300,000 t on a sustainable 
basis. However, climate change and increased predation by Atlantic 
cod could lead to a dramatic fall in the sustainable harvest of northern 
shrimp by up to 70.000 t. as illustrated below.

Fishing territories 
Fishing takes place along most of the Greenland coast with varieties in 
catches depending on local resources. The larger vessels for offshore 
fishing (80 BRT or more) are primarily on the west coast of Greenland, 
covering the Paamiut, Nuuk, Maniitsoq and Sisimiut area. Some 85 per 
cent of the offshore fishing capacity is placed here. The remaining 15 
per cent of the offshore fishing fleet is primarily found in

Qasigiannguit, Ilulissat and Upernavik on the west coast, and in Tasii-
laq on the east coast. These trawlers are normally larger than 80 BRT 
and the majority of them fish Northern shrimp. Many trawlers have 
production facilities on board, but the fishery regulation calls for 25 
per cent of the catch to be processed in land.

Most middle sized vessels (less than 80 BRT) travel to local fishing 
areas not too far off the coast. 

Small scale fishing and hunting of seal and whale from open boats 
takes place along the entire coast and in the fiords. These boats travel 
to local and regional fishing areas just off the coast. The catch is either 
traded at the local fish market or used for private consumption.

The Greenland Fisheries Licence Control Authority only registers 
vessels used for commercial fishing. In accordance with ministerial 
order no. 5 of January 31 2002 on fishery licence, fishing vessels are 
registered as either larger vessels for offshore fishing (longer than 24 
m) or smaller vessels for fishing inshore (less than 24 m). In 2008 the 
Greenland Fisheries Licence Control Authority registered 53 vessels 
for offshore fishing and 519 small and middle sized boats. 

8.3.2 Hunting
Locally, hunting is both economically and socially important, but hunt-
ing does not contribute extensively to the Greenland national economy. 
But traditional hunting is of tremendous cultural value to the people 
of Greenland, passing on from one generation to another the skills and 
knowledge once needed to survive in the Arctic. Furthermore, hunting 
supports the traditional diet of Inuit as much meat from wildlife cannot 
be found in convenient stores. 

In a report on occupational hunting, the formal and informal value 
of hunting to the Greenland economy is estimated at € 52.200.000 
annually, making up for less than 4 per cent of the Greenland GDP 
(Rasmussen, 2005). But full time hunting in common in the northern 
and eastern parts of Greenland and locally the income from hunting is 
important to the wellbeing of a community.  

A little more than half the value of hunting is registered as trade of 
bag, either when traded in at the local production facility or sold at 
the local fish and wildlife market. In the 2005 report the contribution 
of hunting to the informal economy is some € 25.000.000, as hunting 
bag generally is used to supplement the family diet, is used as a gift for 
friends and family or is exchanged in the informal economy. 

Hunting statistics 
The Ministry of Fisheries, Hunting and Agriculture prepares an annual 
report on hunting activities in Greenland, the Piniarneq. Hunting is 
regulated and managed by licences, and information in the Piniarneq 
report is based on the statutory reports on bag by all licensed hunters. 
In the tables below (Table 2 to Table 5) information on game of 
terrestrial mammals, whales, seals and selected birds are presented for 
the years 2002 – 2007. 

8.3.3 Oil, gas and mineral activities
The Bureau of Minerals and Petroleum (BMP) administers hydrocar-
bon and mineral activities in Greenland. The bureau handles applica-
tions for either mineral, oil or gas licences with a one-door process 
making it unnecessary for applicants to contact other agencies within 
the Home Rule Government or the Danish Government. 

Mineral exploration and exploitation
The Bureau of Minerals and Petroleum has granted three exploita-
tion licences for mineral activities, but there are expectations of more 
licence areas in near future. As illustrated below activities are focused 
in a number of locations on the west coast from Cape Farewell to the 
Nuussuaq Peninsula, and on the east coast north of Ittoqqortoormiit. 
Generally, exploitation licences cover small areas of 5 - 8 km2, while 
exploration licences may cover larger areas. 

The Bureau of Minerals and Petroleum use the best international 
practises. An application for an exploitation licence is based on an EIA 
report, an environmental monitoring plan and a plan on closure. The 
latter includes an escrow account with funding for the clean up and 
re-establishing of the area. 

Oil and gas exploration
 Greenland has no exploitation of hydrocarbon resources today, but 
exploration is taking place in 13 offshore licence areas, including an 
area in the northeast part of the Davis Strait and in the southeast Baffin 
Bay, an area west of Nuuk and an area to the south and west of Cape 
Farwell. 

Activities related to oil and gas exploration in the above mentioned 
licence areas, which are expected to have some effect on traffic and 
navigation security in the West Greenlandic waters, are offshore seis-
mic data acquisition as well as exploration drilling. 

Offshore seismic data acquisition is routinely used to identify and 
assess subsurface geological structures, and the potential presence and 
extent of any associated hydrocarbon deposits. Data acquired during 
initial seismic exploration typically assist in defining more prospec-
tive areas. This then can identify prospective geological structures and 
identify the best locations for exploration drilling.

Exploration drilling is an extensive activity which typically will take 
place during the summer months, using either a drilling ship or a drill-
ing rig. An exploration drilling in the waters off West Greenland will 
take place in 2010 to 2014 at the earliest.

Of special interest is the effect shipping of oil and gas will have on the 
overall navigation security and traffic pattern in Greenlandic waters. 
However, the time frame for a possible hydrocarbon production from 
an oil field in the waters off West and Southwest Greenland is more 
than 15 years. Oil and gas exploitation are most likely to develop in 
a limited area, but it is possible that oil and gas exploitation from one 
of the present offshore exploration and exploitation licences can lead 
to conditions comparable to the North Sea today, where a number of 
exploitation facilities are dispersed in a larger area. 

Mineral resource activities in protected areas In Greenland there is 
broad political consensus that measures should be taken to develop the 
mineral resource sector into one of the mainstays of the economy. 

Environmental and nature considerations in connection with mineral 
resources activities are regulated in accordance with order no. 368 of 
June 18 1998 on the Act on Mineral Resources in Greenland, generally 
referred to as the Mineral Resources Act. Current legislation on the 
protection of environment and nature specifically exempt the regula-
tion of activities in connection with exploration and exploitation of 
mineral resources. Therefore, it is possible to perform mineral resource 
activities in protected areas. However, in some cases the Mineral 
Resources Act has stronger protection measures than exclusive nature 
conservation legislation, for example by designating areas where 
mineral resource activities are regulated to address conservation needs, 
e.g. protection of areas important in breeding, calving, moulting and 
resting.  

The Bureau of Minerals and Petroleum has stipulated a set of rules 
for regulation of environmental and nature considerations of mineral 
projects in Regulation on Field Work in Greenland. 

8.3.4 Transportation
Historically travelling by sea has been the primary way for people to 
interact, to do trade and most importantly, to make a living. The kayak 
was used both for travelling and for hunting of marine mammals, 

while the umiaq, a family size rowing boat, was used for transportation 
between the winter and the summer settlement. Where ice cover was 
common dogs and sledges were used both in connection with ice fish-
ing and hunting of marine mammals. 

Currently 56.000 individuals live in Greenland, and four in five 
Greenlanders live in one of the 18 towns along the coast. Only one 
in five individuals lives in a settlement. The west coast towns and 
settlements are scattered from the southernmost point to the Melville 
Bay area north of Upernavik and in the very north around the town of 
Qaanaaq. By comparison, the east coast is sparsely populated by some 
3.500 individuals living in two towns, Tasiilaq and Ittoqqortoormiit, 
and a small number of settlements. The isolated communities along the 
Greenland coast are connected by both sea and air traffic. Air Green-
land operates a net of routes that connects the regions, but sea traffic is 
still an important element of the infrastructure.

All vessels registered in Greenland are regulated by the Danish Mari-
time Authority.

Shipping
Royal Arctic Line serves the entire coast of Greenland with a fleet 
of five container ships, four general cargo ships, one container and 
general cargo ship, and a second container and general cargo ship in 
long-term charter. The main service is between Aalborg, Denmark, and 
the three major ports on the west coast: Nuuk, Sisimiut and Aasiaat. 

On an annual basis Royal Arctic Line travels 140 times between Den-
mark and Greenland, carrying fish and fishery produce to Europe and 
bringing back petroleum products, food, manufactured goods, machin-
ery and transporting equipment. Greenland is dependent on imported 
oil and petroleum products to cover 90 per cent of the energy supply.  

In 2006 the value of the export was € 325.000. The primary export; 
fish and fishery produce is mainly traded within the European market.  
The value of the 2006 import was € 464.250. The primary import 
markets are Denmark and Sweden, which make up for 97 per cent of 
the annual import, while 2 per cent of the import is from the North 
American market. Icelandic Eimship operates in the waters between 
Iceland, Canada and the USA, and Royal Arctic Lines serves the route 
between Reykjavik, Iceland, and Greenland. 

Nationally, containers are carried from Nuuk, Sisimiut or Aasiaat to 
the towns of the west coast. In spring and the early summer the sea 
ice from the east coast drifts to the waters of South Greenland, creat-
ing difficult conditions for shipping, while the north-western waters 
experience sea ice from December until May or June. Tasiilaq on the 
east coast is served seven times a year, while Ittoqqortoormiit on the 
north-eastern coast and the north-western communities of Qaanaaq are 
only served twice every summer. 

Greenland experiences an increase in shipping. Royal Arctic Line 
has seen an increase in activities by 30 percent within five years. The 
increase is due to both an increase in the export of fish and shrimp and 
an increase in the import of consumer goods, machinery and materials 
for construction. 

Beside the Royal Arctic Line service other shipping operators use bulk 
carriers to carry ore from the mining operations to facilities outside 
Greenland. Currently there are two mines in operation: Nalunaq Gold 
Mine in Maarmorilik in the Uummannaq region and Minelco Olivine 
mine near Maniitsoq. However, the Nalunaq Gold Mine is scheduled 
to close in 2009. 

The Home Rule Government expects increases in shipping as the 
decline in ice cover, due to climatic changes, open new sailing routes. 
Furthermore, the planned re-opening of the Black Angle lead and zinc 
mine in Uummannaq, the plans for a new molybdenum mine in the 
Malmbjerg area in north-eastern Greenland, and the planned produc-
tion of aluminium on the island of Maniitsoq are activities which are 
most likely to further an increase in shipping in Greenlandic waters. 
For construction large quantities of materials will be imported to built 
the smelter, two hydropower plants and infrastructure, and when the 
smelter opens carriers will be needed to ship bauxite to the smelter and 
to bring aluminium to the markets in both North America and Europe.

Sea travel
 Even if air travel predominates in modern Greenland, ferries and small 
boats still play an important role in connecting communities. In 2008 
one ferry and 11 passenger boats travel in Greenlandic waters. These 
vessels are regulated by the Danish Maritime Authority’s regulations 
for small vessels carrying passengers. 

Arctic Umiaq Line operates the only long distance ferry service on the 
west coast of Greenland, from Narsarsuaq in the south to Ilulissat in 
the north, visiting 12 towns and settlements on the way. The service 
operates from April to December, while the ice cover brings the serv-
ice to a stand-still in the last months of the winter and the early spring. 

In the Qaqortoq and Narsaq area and in the Disco Bay area local 
ferries connect towns and settlements, but operations are sometimes 
challenged by sea ice. Settlements are served by smaller boats carrying 
both goods and passengers. Disko Line has 6 passenger boats serving 
the Ilulissat, Aasiaat and Qeqertarsuaq and even smaller services con-
nects settlements. Royal Arctic Settlement Service provides a service 
from Qeqertarsuaq to Kangerluk in the Disco Bay area, from Arsuk to 
Sarfannguaq in Southwest Greenland and in the Tasiilaq district on the 
east coast. However, privately owned small boats are often used for 
both fishing and commuting. 

8.3.5 Tourism
Tourism activities at sea can be divided into three main categories; 
man-powered activities at sea, small passenger boat activities and sea 
cruise activities. The text below focuses on sea cruise activities as they 
are likely to have the largest consequences for the marine environment 
in Greenland.  

Man-powered activities at sea 
Sea kayaking in small groups or in cooperation with a local operator 
is the primary form of man-powered activities at sea. Generally, sea 
kayakers and operators have very high standards regarding waste treat-
ment and will leave no sign of their presence, but as sea kayakers can 
go everywhere with very few limitations there are no actual regula-
tions along most of the south-east and west coast. 

Greenland Tourism & Business Council estimates that there are 
between 500 - 700 sea kayakers per year doing multiple day trips.

Small passenger boat activities
A large number of small motor vessels, often carrying less than 50 
passengers, are operated by local tour operators. They usually operate 
within 50 nm of their base, but some vessels are chartered to travel 
along the coast. Fishing tourism in the fiords is only carried out on a 
limited basis.

The Danish Maritime Authority’s regulations for small vessels carry-
ing passengers apply to these activities. 

Sea cruise activities
Greenland has experienced an increase in cruise tourism over the last 
decade. This interest has been sparked both by the effort made by 
Greenland Tourism & Business Council to promote cruise tourism 
in Greenland and by the international focus on climate change in the 
Arctic. 

Cruise tourism covers a wide range of vessels from small expedition 
type vessels of 50 to 100 passengers to large ships carrying up to 4.000 
passengers. In 2008 more than 50.000 passengers and crew members 
visited Greenland waters, making more than 350 calls. 

Cruise tourism is common all along the coast, but activities are con-
centrated in the south-western regions from Qaqortoq to Ilulissat. Dur-
ing summer an increasing number of transatlantic cruises from Europe 
to North America include Greenland calls. Other transatlantic routes 
run from Canada to the very north of Greenland or from continental 
Europe via Svalbard in Norway, the Faroe Islands or Iceland across 
Denmark Strait to the east coast of Greenland.  
 
However, most cruise ships travel within Greenlandic waters. The 
busiest ports are currently Qaqortoq, Nuuk, Sisimiut and Ilulissat, 
but Nanortalik, Narsarsuaq, Qeqertarsuaq and Uummannaq are also 

frequently visited. An increasing number of turnarounds are done in 
Kangerlussuaq. 

Another area of interest is the east coast of Greenland, where It-
toqqortoormiit had 19 arrivals and Tasiilaq 6 arrivals in 2008. North 
of Ittoqqortoormiit is the National Park, where access is restricted and 
permits must be attained prior to arrival. Cruise ships can however 
travel in waters 3 nm off the coast without any permit. 

The high north of West Greenland has experienced an increase in 
cruise ship activities over the last years. Traditionally, the Upernavik 
and Qaanaaq area has not seen much tourism, but in 2008 10 of the 43 
cruise ships in Greenland waters were scheduled to cruise the northern 
waters. 

8.3.6 Non-commercial marine activities
A number of non-commercial activities may influence the marine envi-
ronment. Some of these activities are of small scale and do not impact 
the marine environment, while other activities may influence marine 
environment and nature and may call for measures of protection.

Research activities
Due to a wide range of factors, e.g. the increase in mineral resource 
activities, the increased awareness of the climate change and the 
consequences in the Arctic, and research during the International Polar 
Year (IPY), the number of researchers working in Greenland have 
increased. Generally, research activities have only a small effect on 
the marine environment as researchers and expedition teams generally 
observe high standards of environmental protection. 

Research focuses on the marine ecosystems in waters sparsely covered 
today. When findings are made available to the authorities Greenland 
benefits from these research activities as management is based on 
better data. But an effort must be made in order to make research and 
findings available to the general public. 

Small boat ownership
Small boats are used for non-commercial transportation and fishing. 
There is no register on private ownership of boats, but the Home Rule 
Government has information on 3.000 – 5.000 small boats and open 
dinghies (weight < 5 BRT) in use. These boats pose a minor threat 
to the marine environment and nature while in use, but disposing off 
small boats, fishing vessels and even tankers is a challenge as there is 
no national recycling industry. 

The authorities receive reports on illegal dumping of boats 2 to 4 times 
a year.  

Waste water
 

There are no waste water treatment plants in Greenland today. Waste 
water produced both on land and at sea is disposed off into the ocean. 
Most households have drains that connect with public sewers, but there 
are still households with no access to sewerage. These houses often 
have an open waste pipe allowing washing water to run into the ter-
rain, while toilet water is collected and disposed off into the ocean. 

Industrial waste water from the small scale industry is also disposed 
off into the ocean. 
The Environmental and Nature Agency prepares regulations of waste 
water management and regional waste water planning to be issued in 
2009. 

8.4 The Greenland Home Rule Government and institutions 
The public administration of Greenland consists of a national admin-
istration and an extensive local administration, both led by elected 
assemblies. 

8.4.1 The Greenland Home Rule - Namminersornerullutik Oqartussat
 

For almost thirty years the relationship between Greenland and Den-
mark has been regulated by the Greenland Home Rule Act no. 577 of 
29 November 1978. 

ICAS 
Attachment 3



72

The Home Rule was introduced on 1 May 1979 and the Home Rule 
authorities, i.e. the Greenland Parliament (Inatsisartut) and the cabinet 
(Naalakkersuisut), still conduct affairs in accordance with the provi-
sions laid down in the act of 1978. 

The Greenland Home Rule Government is divided into seven min-
istries: the Premier’s Office, the Ministry of Finances and Foreign 
Affairs, the Ministry of Industry and Labour, the Ministry of Education 
and Culture, the Ministry of Fisheries, Hunting and Agriculture, the 
Ministry of Family Affairs, and Health and the Ministry of Infrastruc-
ture and Environment. Within each ministry there are a number of 
agencies and departments. 

The Bureau of Minerals and Petroleum manages all activities related 
to the exploration and exploitation of oil, gas and mineral resources. 
The bureau refers to the Greenland Home Rule Government and to the 
Danish Government via the Joint Committee on Mineral Resources in 
Greenland. 

In relation to oceans management, the Greenland Home Rule has 
jurisdiction over activities within 3 nautical miles off the coast, e.g. 
fishing and shipping, activities related to national and regional plan-
ning, infrastructure and transportation, hunting and agriculture, and the 
conservation and protection of the environment and nature. 

Outside the Greenland territory, 3 nm off the coast, ocean management 
is under Danish jurisdiction. 

In ocean management the government seeks advice from a wide range 
of independent institutions, including Greenland Institute of Natural 
Resources, Asiaq/ Greenland Survey, and the Danish National Envi-
ronmental Research Institute (NERI). The administration also has a 
strong tradition of dialog and exchange of knowledge with the Danish 
administration. 

Home Rule is succeeded by Self-Government 
The Danish-Greenlandic Commission on Greenlandic Self-Govern-
ment, which was established in 2004 to discuss the future relationship 
between Denmark and Greenland and to identify fields of responsibil-
ity that could be transferred to Greenland, concluded its work in 2008. 
The commission presented to the public a detailed commission report 
and a draft for an Act on Greenland Self-Government to succeed the 
Greenland Home Rule Act of 1979.

The people of Greenland endorsed the draft Self-Government Act at 
a public referendum on 25 November 2008. The Greenland Home 
Rule is likely to be succeeded by the new Self-Government on 21 June 
2009, celebrated as the National Day in Greenland. 

The new act recognizes the people of Greenland as a people pursuant 
to international law with the right to self-determination and includes 
a provision establishing Kalaallisut, the Inuit language spoken in 
Greenland, as the official language. Furthermore, the draft act on 
Self-Government states that Greenland can have jurisdiction and 
financial responsibility of all aspects of public affairs if the parliament, 
Inatsisartut, so decides. However, a self-governed Greenland will still 
be part of the Kingdom of Denmark and share foreign policies with 
Denmark and the Faroe Islands.

The Self-Government Act also outlines the future economic relation-
ship between Greenland and Denmark. The Danish-Greenlandic Com-
mission agreed that Greenland has the right to the mineral resources 
in Greenland. In § 5 of the draft Self-Government Act, Greenland 
will still receive an annual grant of € 430.000.000. But if, in the years 
to come, the income from activities related to the exploitation of oil, 
gas or mineral resources climbs to more than € 10.000.000 annually, 
Greenland will see a 50 cent reduction in the grant for every additional 
€ 1 earned from these activities. 

In accordance with the Self-Government Act financial independence 
from Denmark is realized when the activities in the oil and mineral 
industry reach € 860.000.000 a year. Talks on the future relationship 
between Greenland and Denmark will then commence. The people of 
Greenland can, in accordance with § 21 of the Self-Government Act, 
decide on independence in a future referendum. 

8.4.2 The local administration of municipalities and regions
 At the local level, the administrative structure resembles the structure 
of the national level. Since 1979, Greenland has been divided into 18 
municipalities governing local affairs, e.g. schools, waste management, 
local planning. Each municipality, covering one town and a number of 
settlements, was governed by a municipal council. In 2009 a structural 
reform merged the 18 municipalities into 4 regions. The aim of the 
reform is primarily to reduce public spending and to provide better 
service to the citizens. 

The small municipalities of the northern region are merged with the 
more populous and prosperous Disco region into the new Qaasuitsup 
Kommunea (Fig. 11: Avannaa), while Ammassalik and Ittoqqor-
toormiit will merge with Paamiut and Nuuk in one large region, the 
Kommuneqarfik Sermersooq (Fig. 11: Kangia-Kitaa). The Qeqqata 
Kommunea is formed around Sisimiut and Maniitsoq (Fig. II: Qeqqa) 
and in the south Qaqortoq, Narsaq and Narsarsuaq will merge into 
Kommune Kujalleq (Fig. 11: Kujataa).

In relation to the marine environment, the municipalities are responsi-
ble for the management of waste and sewerage locally and for protec-
tion of the marine environment close to the towns and settlements, i.e. 
the handling of oil spills. 

8.4.3 Greenland’s economy
 

The Greenland fishing industry developed late compared to other fish-
ing nations in the Atlantic, e.g. Iceland. Therefore, the Greenland fish-
ing activity was relatively insignificant during the first half of the 20th 
century, even when compared to the rest of the Greenland economy. 
But based on underexploited fish stocks, the Greenland fishing indus-
try expanded smoothly until the 1980s. The cod fishery experienced 
a major expansion in the latter half of the 1970s due to reduction in 
foreign fisheries activities following the extension of the Greenland 
fisheries jurisdiction to 200 nautical miles. However, in 1981 there 
was a major contraction of the cod fishery due to overfishing and low 
export prices. For three years the Greenland gross domestic product 
(GPD) decreased by 9 per cent annually. From 1985 there was a 
second short-lived boom in the cod fishery that led to a corresponding 
boom in the economy, but this boom was followed by another depres-
sion during which the GDP decreased by over 20 per cent. 
Time series data for the export value of the fishing industry are avail-
able from 1966 till today. These data have been used to estimate the 

Figure 11. The 2009 reform and the four new regions; the North region now 
named Qaasuitsup Kommunia, the mid region Qeqqata Kommunia, the 
East-West Kommuneqarfik Sermersooq and the southern Kommune Kujalleq.

form and parameters of relationship between GDP and the real export 
value of the fish products. It is projected that a 1 per cent increase in 
the export value of fish products will lead to a 0.29 per cent increase 
in the GDP of Greenland. This equation can be used to predict the 
economic impact of a change in fish stock availability resulting from 
climate change. 

Scenarios for the future 
Emmett Duffy discusses three scenarios for the future of the fisher-
ies and thereby the future of the Greenland economy (Emmett Duffy, 
2007). The pessimistic scenario assumes that despite favourable 
habitat conditions the Atlantic cod will not re-establish permanently 
in Greenland waters. Instead, there will be periodic highs in the cod 
fishery followed by lows, and corresponding changes in shrimp fisher-
ies. In the moderate scenario as described by Emmett Duffy, Greenland 
will see a modest and gradual return of Atlantic cod to Greenland, 
which in 20 years will be capable of yielding 100.000 t. / year. The 
increase in the availability of fish leads to a moderate long-term 
increase in GDP of 6 per cent. A third, optimistic scenario, assumes a 
return of the Greenland cod stock, initially generated by Icelandic cod 
larval drift to the levels of the 1950s and 1960s. A full revival would 
take some decades, but in 30 years the cod stock would be capable 
of producing an average yield of 300.000 t. a year. This scenario will 
lead to an ultimate increase in GDP of 28 per cent compared with what 
would otherwise have been the case. 

The social impacts of these future scenarios are important. If the op-
timistic scenario was to occur and the increase in Atlantic cod harvest 
was mainly caught by Greenland fishermen and processed for export 
in Greenland, it would remedy the unemployment situation and create 
an income for the large group of self- employed fishermen and hunters. 
A climb in cod fishery might lead to large scale fish processing plants 
being established in some of the more densely populated regions of 
Greenland. 

The economic and social impacts of changes in fish stock availability 
depends on the direction, magnitude and rapidity of these changes, but 
also on society’s ability to respond and adjust to new conditions and 
thereby mitigate the negative impacts of change. 

Within the next decade changes are expected in sectors besides the 
fisheries. American Alcoa plans to open an aluminium smelter in Ma-
niitsoq in 2015, creating employment in both construction and in the 
operation of the smelter. Establishing an industrial facility in a small 
community will dramatically increase activities in both Maniitsoq 
and in the neighbouring communities as the need for both goods and 
services will increase. In the mineral industry exploration licences may 
result in new mines being opened, while in the tourism sector steps are 
taken to maintain the interest in Greenland’s unique nature and culture. 
Finally, more jobs will be created in the public sector if Greenland 
continues on the road towards increased independence from Denmark. 

8.4.4. Enforcement of sea territories 
Greenland has a 3 nm territorial sea boundary. The territory includes 
fiords, harbours and waters within 3 nm off the extreme points of the 
coast. These waters are protected by the regulations laid down in Act 
no. 4 of 3 November 1994 on Marine Protection, with later amend-
ments. National Park regulations protects the waters of the National 
Park area to the 3 nm territorial sea boundary too.  

Participating in the monitoring and protection of the sea is Danish 
Ministry of Defence, i.e. Island Command Greenland and the Sirius 
Patrol in the National Park, MRCC Groennedal, the Danish Polar 
Centre, the Environmental and Nature Agency of the Greenland Home 
Rule, and local authorities. 

The Environmental and Nature Agency, in close cooperation with 
local authorities, run pollution control and clean up after oil spills 
etc. Contingency plans have been established and the Home Rule has 
provided oil spill equipment, including oil skimmers, floating barrages, 
oil absorbent granulate or textile, storage tanks etc. in 11 towns on the 
West coast and Tasiilaq on the East coast. Currently, the oil spill equip-
ment can only handle small and medium sized spills, and distances and 
weather conditions are important in managing spills. 

Island Command Greenland, based in Groennedal, offer assistance 
in rescue operations and environmental operations at sea within the 
Greenland sea territory too. 

The Danish sea territory extents from the 3 nm zone to the 200 nm 
Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ line). This territory is protected by the 
Danish Marine Protection Act from 1993 with later amendments. The 
Danish sea territory is guarded by the Danish State, in particular the 
Danish Ministry of Defence and Island Command Greenland. Island 
Command Greenland operates inspection vessels and helicopters to 
control the territory, participate in rescue operations and the clean up 
of spills at sea. The Sirius Patrol of the Ministry of Defence monitors 
activities in the National Park area. The Maritime Rescue Coordination 
Centre, MRCC Groennedal, monitors sea traffic via the GREENPOS 
positioning system and initiate rescue operations. 

8.5 Policies and approaches in oceans management
Below is a description of applied ocean management policies and 
approaches in fisheries, in the management of oil, gas and mineral 
resources, in shipping and tourism and finally in management of nature 
and wildlife.

8.5.1 Fisheries practices and management status
Fishing and hunting is regulated by the Ministry of Fishery, Hunting 
and Agriculture. The Greenland Fisheries Licence Control Authority 
conducts fishery inspection while the Greenland Institute of Natural 
Resources monitors stocks. The fishing industry tries to balance the 
possibilities of modern fishing technology with the need to sustain the 
natural resources. The quota system managed by the Ministry of Fish-
ery, Hunting and Agriculture is a two-tier system which differentiates 
inshore fishery from offshore fishery of northern shrimp, Atlantic cod 
and Greenland halibut.Management of the Greenland fisheries focuses 
on individual species. Greenland has not implemented ecosystem-
based management systematically, but measures such as periodical and 
geographical restrictions apply in some fisheries. 

Aim of the management of fisheries
The overall purpose of the current management scheme is to secure 
a sustainable and responsible fishery that considers the interest of as 
many as possible. 

Central to the management scheme is a quota system, based on annual 
Total Allowable Catches (TAC’s) and biological advice, and rules 
regarding ownership of fishing vessels. Current management prin-
ciples inhibits introduction of new fishing capacity, although it does 
not inhibit enhancement of existing capacity through technological 
improvements.

For commercial fishing one has to apply for a licence and a quota. 
Each licence includes restrictions, e.g. maximum quota, time of year, 
geographical access and technical requirements following the Fisheries 
Act and government orders of the Home Rule. 

Setting the TAC level
 In order to keep harvest levels within sustainable limits, TAC’s for in-
dividual species are based on biological advice from the researchers of 
the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources. The advice makes use of 
the best available knowledge and is often based on recommendations 
from regional and scientific organizations.  

The Minister for the Fisheries, Hunting and Agriculture recommends 
annual TAC’s to the government and thereafter the government agrees 
to accept the recommendations or to suggest alterations. 

Stakeholder involvement
Stakeholder involvement is central to the activities of the Fisheries 
Council. The Fisheries Council brings together representatives from 
the costal and the offshore fisheries organizations, the workers union 
(SIK) and the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources. 

When a decision cannot be made based on current legislation the 
stakeholders are involved via the Fisheries Council. But the council 
also meets on a regular basis to discuss themes relevant to the council 

ICAS 
Attachment 3



74

and to bring forward recommendations and opinions to the political 
level. 

Economic modelling 
To improve consequence analysis of the Greenland fisheries, an effort 
is made to develop better economic models these years. Currently, 
a model for the financially important fishery of northern shrimp is 
developed to include the fishery of Greenland halibut too. The models 
seek to cover as many socio-economic factors as feasible, using the 
best available knowledge. Stakeholders like the Fisheries Council, 
representatives from the industry and the unions of both employers and 
employees are involved in providing accurate data for the models. 

International cooperation
Greenland is a member of a number of regional organizations and 
cooperates further through bilateral agreements on both stocks and 
control issues. The most important organizations are mentioned below: 

The Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization
 (NAFO): The NAFO convention area covers the entire west coast 
of Greenland where most of the Greenland fishery resources are 
harvested. NAFO is in the process of modernizing its convention to 
include principles of ecosystem management. At the 29th annual meet-
ing in Lisbon, NAFO members approved this modernization and each 
member is now in the process of ratifying the updated convention. 

The North East Atlantic Fisheries Commission
(NEAFC):  The NEAFC convention area covers the east coast of 
Greenland and has also been modernized recently to focus more on 
ecosystems. 

The North Atlantic Salmon Conservation Organization 
(NASCO): The NASCO works to promote the conservation, restora-
tion and management of salmon stocks. The organization focuses on a 
single species. Greenland has agreed not to utilize wild salmon stocks 
commercially. 

Cooperation on fisheries management is also facilitated through the 
North Atlantic Fisheries Ministers Conference (NAFMC) and through 
the Nordic Council of Ministers (NCMS). Greenland is a member of 
both forums.

Greenland has bilateral agreements on the exchange of quotas with 
Norway, Iceland, The Faroe Islands and Russia. Furthermore, Green-
land has a fish-for-money agreement with the EU. These agreements 
include cooperation on control and enforcement issues mainly in the 
exchange of data. Currently negotiations are ongoing with Canada to 
engage in formal cooperation. 

8.5.2 Oil, gas and mineral practices and management
The mineral resources system establishes that the political respon-
sibility for the mineral resources area is a joint Danish-Greenlandic 
concern. This infers that Greenland and Denmark have joint decision 
competence for significant dispositions in the field of mineral resource.

The Joint Committee on Mineral Resources in Greenland 
The Joint Committee on Mineral Resources in Greenland has been es-
tablished as a political forum, consisting of politicians from Greenland 
and Denmark, in which central issues concerning the mineral resources 
are debated. 

The Joint Committee on Mineral Resources in Greenland consists of 
five political members appointed by the Greenland Parliament (Inatsi-
sartut) and the Danish Parliament, respectively. In addition a chairman 
is appointed by the Queen after common nomination from the Govern-
ment and the Greenland Home Rule Government for four-year terms. 

The purpose of the Joint Committee is to follow the development 
in the mineral resources area and to submit recommendations to the 
Government and the Home Rule Government in e.g. issues on granting 
reconnaissance and exploitation licences.

The detailed regulation on the mineral resources system are laid down 
partly in the Greenland Home Rule Act and partly in the Act on Min-
eral Resources in Greenland, no. 368 of 18 June 1998. 

The Bureau of Minerals and Petroleum under the Greenland 
Home Rule 
The Bureau of Minerals and Petroleum under the Greenland Home 
Rule is responsible for the management of the mineral resources area 
in Greenland. 

The basis for the activities in the mineral resource sector is the ambi-
tious objectives to provide a basis for all mineral resources activities 
so that these activities can be implemented in consideration of a sound 
environment and in accordance with the highest international standards 
for the purpose of protecting the vulnerable Arctic nature. On this 
background the Bureau of Minerals and Petroleum draws on the ex-
pertise of the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS), 
the Danish National Environmental Research Institute (NERI) and the 
Danish Energy Agency (DEA) within the Danish Ministry of Climate 
and Energy. 

Environmental impact assessments
In connection with the opening of frontier areas with technologically 
challenging conditions the Bureau of Minerals and Petroleum develops 
Strategic Environmental Impact Assessments (SEIA) as part of the 
basis of decision in relation to granting licences to the hydrocarbon 
industry. The SEIA provides an overview of the environment in the 
licence area and adjacent areas, which may potentially be impacted by 
the hydrocarbon activities, and identifies major potential effects associ-
ated with future offshore hydrocarbon activities. Furthermore the SEIA 
identifies gaps in knowledge and data, highlight issues of concern, 
make recommendations for mitigation and planning and identifies 
general restrictive or mitigative measures and monitoring requirements 
that must be dealt with by the companies applying for hydrocarbon 
licences. 

However, it is the responsibility of the license holding companies to 
prepare Environment Impact Assessments (EIA) for their specific 
activities. The company initiated EIA must cover the entire region that 
might be affected, including land facilities. It also must cover trans-
boundary aspects, including the impacts of oil pollution on neighbour-
ing countries. The EIA shall include the full lifecycle of activities: 
exploration, field development, production transport and decommis-
sioning. The EIA must be updated and further developed when needed, 
e.g. when moving from the explorations to the production phase, or 
if there is a change in the plans presented in the EIA. The initial EIA 
related primarily to exploratory drilling shall focus on this activity, but 
must include assessment of scenarios of possible activities related to 
production, transport and decommissioning. 

The Bureau of Minerals and Petroleum has developed guidelines for 
preparing an Environmental Impact Assessment report. In developing 
these guidelines, information on the requirements to EIAs related to 
hydrocarbon exploration, development, production, decommission-
ing and transport in other Arctic countries has been studied. Valuable 
information was found in material from Alaska, Canada and Norway. 
Furthermore, the guidelines are based on the Arctic Offshore Oil 
& Gas Guidelines issued by the Arctic Council, and on the OSPAR 
Guidelines for Monitoring the Environmental Impacts of Offshore Oil 
and Gas Activities.

Similar EIA guidelines have been prepared for mining companies 
operating in Greenland.

Environmental assessments of activities related to hydrocarbon 
exploration offshore West Greenland was initiated in 1992, when the 
National Environmental Research Institute made a review of the avail-
able data which could be used to assess activities related to hydrocar-
bon exploration in the eastern Davis Strait during summer (Boertmann 
et al., 1992). Based on this review studies were initiated to improve 
knowledge of seabird colonies (Boertmann et al. 1996), moulting 
areas and offshore seabird concentrations (Durinck & Falck 1996, 
Mosbech et al. 1996). The main ecological issues related to offshore 
hydrocarbon exploration in Greenland were reviewed (Mosbech et al. 
1995) and an initial assessment of potential environmental impacts of 
hydrocarbon exploration in the Fylla area located in the Davis Strait 
was conducted (Mosbech et al. 1996). The Fylla area is one of the 
most productive regions in Greenlandic waters and it represents an im-
portant site for birds, marine mammals and fisheries. The most serious 

ICAS 
Attachment 3



75

potential impact of oil exploration in the Fylla area is a major oil spill, 
especially if the spill reaches the coast. To minimize the environmental 
risk of large oil spills during oil exploration, emphasis is put on plan-
ning of activities to avoid operations during the most sensitive periods 
and in the most sensitive areas, and first of all to operate safely and 
to prevent accidental spills. To enhance damage control during a spill 
operational environmental oil spill sensitivity maps covering the West 
Greenland coastal zone between 62°N to 68°N has been produced 
(Mosbech et al. 2000).

In continuation of these maps and as part of the preparations for 
exploratory drilling offshore West Greenland an environmental oil spill 
sensitivity atlas for the South Greenland costal zone was produced in 
2004 (Mosbech et al. 2004a). The objective of this project was to pro-
duce an overview of resources vulnerable to oil spills, e.g. biological 
resources, and to draft responses to oil spills in this region. Further-
more, there exists an environmental oil spill sensitivity atlas for the 
region between 68°N and 72°N in West Greenland, including offshore 
waters to the Canadian border (Mosbech et al. 2004b). 

Recently, a SEIA of activities related to exploration, development and 
exploitation of hydrocarbon in the sea off West Greenland between 
67°N and 71°N has been produced (Mosbech et al. 2007). The offshore 
waters and coastal areas is the focus of this SEIA as they may be most 
affected by activities related to hydrocarbon exploration, particularly 
from accidental oil spills. The assessment area is very important in 
an ecological context. Biological production in spring and summer is 
very high, there are rich benthic communities and large and important 
seabird and marine mammal populations. Fish and shrimp stocks in the 
area contribute significantly to the fishing industry in Greenland, and 
local communities utilise the coastal areas through subsistence hunting 
and fishing. The assessment had identified where more knowledge is 
needed to assess possible impacts of activities related to oil and gas 
exploration and exploitation. A plan for supplementary background 
studies to fill identified information gaps at the overall strategic level 
has therefore been developed. 

The northwest Baffin Bay, which geologically is an important north-
ward extension of the region between 68°N and 72°N, is considered 
opened for oil and gas exploration, and therefore another SEIA of this 
region has been initiated. In that respect, background data are needed 
and a series of new projects are in the planning phase, some of which 
represent extensions to the projects from the region just south of the 
Baffin Bay area.

The East Greenland rift basins have recently been in focus due to the 
U.S. Geological Survey’s assessment of expected undiscovered oil and 
gas resources in the shelf region. The main targets for oil exploration is 
from north to south the Danmarkshavn basin, the East Greenland basin 
including the Jameson Land basin, and the less known Kangerlussuaq 
basin. However, the Danmarkshavn basin offshore Northeast Green-
land is expected to contain the most of the undiscovered hydrocarbon 
resources. 

In relation to a future licence call offshore Northeast Greenland the 
Bureau of Minerals and Petroleum and the Danish National Environ-
mental Research Institute are working on the development of a SEIA 
related to exploration, development and exploitation of oil and gas in 
the sea off Northeast Greenland. Environmental background studies 
were initiated in 2007 and the studies are expected to strengthen the 
knowledge base for planning, mitigation and regulation of oil and gas 
activities in the assessment area. The main issues and some of the pre-
liminary results and analysis from the background study programme 
are to be incorporated into a preliminary SEIA by the end of 2008. The 
final SEIA is to be issued in 2010.

8.5.3 Management of shipping
The Maritime Rescue Coordination Center in Greenland, MRCC 
Groennedal, monitors shipping along the Greenland coast using the 
GREENPOS ship reporting system. Since 2002 all ships have been 
obliged to report information, including vessel name and ID, position, 
destination, personnel, and current weather and ice situation upon 
entering Greenlandic waters. The ships report their position, course, 
speed and actual weather information to MRCC Groennedal via 

GREENPOS every six hours while sailing in Greenland waters. When 
no report is received and no radio or satellite contact can be made with 
a ship, a rescue operation is prepared. A final report is sent to GREEN-
POS upon departure. Aasiaat Costal Radio is used for communication 
at sea.

Besides reporting to the GREENPOS system any ship registered out-
side the Kingdom of Denmark has to seek diplomatic clearance before 
entering the 3 nm territorial waters. 

Safety at sea
The Danish Maritime Authority, the Danish Maritime Safety Admin-
istration and the National Survey and Cadastre in the 2006 report 
Safe Shipping in Greenlandic Waters made recommendations on the 
improvement of safety at sea. The recommendations included the use 
of searchlights, updating charts and mapping of recommended sea pas-
sages, the use of ice guides/ local guides onboard, and the development 
of electronic identification and tracking systems. 

Working groups were established to initiate the implementation of 
the recommendations in Greenland. In 2009 the Danish Maritime 
Authority plans to issue regulation on mandatory use of searchlights 
to improve ice detection. Also national regulations, i.e. an order on 
safety of navigation in Greenland waters, will be issued by the Danish 
Maritime Authority in 2009. 

The National Survey and Cadastre will update charts of Greenland 
waters in 2007 to 2012, and based on these charts recommended sea 
passages can be mapped. Focusing on the safety at sea for small boats, 
campaigns have addressed the importance of basic skills, including 
landfall, the reading of maps and the use of emergency radios.

8.5.4 Management of cruise tourism
 

As Greenland experience an increase in cruise ship tourism, the con-
sequences of these activities on both local communities and the Arctic 
nature must be monitored.  As large numbers of cruise ship tourists 
visit the small communities of Greenland. They bring trade, but they 
also necessitate an increased need for nature conservation and regula-
tion on access to vulnerable nature and the need for improved waste 
management in towns and settlements. In developing cruise ship tour-
ism and in meeting the challenges of these activities the municipalities 
are important as they provide services locally. 

Almost all cruise ships report planned calls well in advance to the local 
port agents. In the annually published Cruise Manual Greenland Tour-
ism & Business Council recommends ports capable of handling ships 
of a certain size, but ultimately the operators and the captains of the 
cruise ships decide weather to follow these recommendations. 

The marine environment 
The marine environment is protected by the Marine Protection Act, 
no. 4 of 3rd of November 1994 with later amendments, while waters 
outside the 3 nm zone is protected by Danish legislation. The Marine 
Protection Act prohibits dumping of materials and waste and allows 
for regulation on discharge of waste water from ships. The marine 
environment within the National Park and the marine nature reserve in 
Melville Bay are furthermore protected by the regulations issued for 
these areas. 

Denmark is a member of the International Maritime Organization 
(IMO), and international conventions on protection of the marine envi-
ronment are effective too. The operators of large cruise ships observe 
the international conventions on marine protection.

Greenland Tourism & Business Council states that most small expedi-
tion cruise operators that visit Greenland are members of the Associa-
tion of Arctic Expedition Cruise Operators (AECO). AECO members 
agree that expedition cruises and tourism must be carried out with the 
utmost consideration for the vulnerable environment, local cultures 
and cultural remains as well as the challenging safety hazards at sea. 
Greenland Tourism & Business Council and the Environmental and 
Nature Agency of the Home Rule are involved in developing guide-
lines for expedition cruises in the Arctic.

ICAS

Cruise ships and safety at sea 
The consequences of an accident involving a cruise ship at sea may 
however be more important as both rescue operations and clean up can 
be challenged by harsh weather conditions and long distances. Cur-
rently, measures are introduced to improve safety at sea, as described 
above in section 8.5.3, and these measures are significant to cruise ship 
operators too.

Cruise ships report information on position etc. to Island Command 
Greenland via the GREENPOS system, but there is no regulation 
on routes. As some waters are still poorly charted Island Command 
Greenland recommend that all ships sailing in these waters travel in 
groups of two or more for safety reasons. This again is not a formal 
regulation. 

8.5.5 Nature management
The administration of nature management is shared between the Min-
istry of Infrastructure and Environment and the Ministry of Fishery, 
Hunting and Agriculture within the Greenland Home Rule.  

8.5.5.1 Wildlife management

The Ministry of Fisheries, Hunting and Agriculture has issued a series 
of regulations on hunting, including the Greenland Home Rule Act no. 
12 of 29 October 1999 on hunting with later amendments, and a series 
of ministerial orders regulating the quota regulated hunt for single 
species, including the walrus, polar bear, white whale and narwhal. 
Regulated are also the hunt for caribou (Rangifer tarandus), and musk 
ox (Ovibos moschantus). 

At present, Greenland has not implemented ecosystem-based wildlife 
management. Wildlife management today focuses on harvest manage-
ment of individual species. This, however, do involve some aspects of 
ecosystem-based management through cross-sectoral involvement of 
relevant authorities and stakeholder consultation. 

The Greenland government is in the process of developing procedures 
for ecosystem-based management that will take account of available 
financial resources and seek to meet the overall management aims for 
Greenland’s living resources.

International cooperation
Greenland is represented in a number of international forums that 
provide recommendations for management of wildlife species. Only 
recommendations made by the International Whaling Commission 
(IWC) are legally binding. 

The International Whaling Commission (IWC):  Greenland is repre-
sented in IWC via Denmark. The aim of the IWC is to conserve whales 
and to ensure sustainable harvest levels. 

The North Atlantic Marine Mammal Commission (NAMMCO): 
Greenland, together with Norway, Iceland and Faeroe Islands, is a 
member of NAMMCO. NAMMCO works for regional protection, 
rational management and research on marine mammals in the North 
Atlantic. Canada is not a member of NAMMCO and it has therefore 
been necessary to establish forums for bilateral collaboration on shared 
populations of marine mammals, i.e. the Joint Committee for Narwhal 
and Beluga between Canada and Greenland and the working group for 
joint management of the polar bear. 

The Joint Committee for Narwhal and Beluga between Canada 
and Greenland (JCNB): The JCNB provides biological and manage-
ment advice for shared populations of narwhal (Monodon monoceros), 
beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) and walrus (Odobenus rosmarus) in 
the sea between Greenland and Canada.

The Conservation of Arctic Flora and Fauna (CAFF): CAFF is 
one of the six permanent working groups within the Arctic Council. 
The aim of the working group is to address the conservation of Arctic 
biodiversity and to promote practices which ensure the sustainability of 
the Arctic’s living resources. Greenland chairs CAFF in 2006 - 2009. 

The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of 
Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES): CITES was laid out by the 
Washington Convention in 1977, and Greenland participates in CITES. 
The CITES administration is managed by the Environmental and 
Nature Agency of the Greenland Home Rule, and there is cooperation 
with the Forestry and Nature Agency in Denmark.  

The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN): 
Greenland participates in the IUCN. 

Bilateral agreements: Each year the Greenland Home Rule Govern-
ment provides mandate to bilateral consultations between Greenland 
and other countries regarding common stocks of fish and marine 
mammals. The Home Rule Government provides mandate for signing 
agreements from case to case. 

Harvest management process
The management of Greenland’s living resources is divided between 
three ministries: the Ministry of Fishery, Hunting and Agriculture, 
who is responsible for the management of commercially exploited fish 
species, terrestrial mammals and marine mammals (including polar 
bears), the Ministry of Infrastructure and Environment responsible 
for international agreements and conventions regarding biodiversity 
(ext. IUCN) and nature conservation, and the Ministry of Industry and 
Labour, who is responsible for trophy hunting, sport fishing and other 
tourism activities related to wildlife, e.g. whale watching. 

Biological advice on harvest management
The Greenland Institute of Natural Resources provides management 
advice through participation in the scientific committees of the rel-
evant international organizations, such as IWC, NAMMCO or JCNB. 
For populations not covered by international agreements, such as musk 
ox and caribou, the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources provides 
scientific advice upon request from the managing authority. 

Upon request from the managing authority, the Greenland Institute 
of Natural Resources provides advice on sustainable harvest levels 
and other regulatory mechanisms for all species under quota manage-
ment, except advice on larger whales as they are the responsibility of 
the IWC. Advice on sustainable harvest levels makes use of the best 
available knowledge and often it is based on recommendations from 
international forums.

Based on advice on sustainable harvest levels, harvest statistics and 
user knowledge, the Ministry of Fisheries, Hunting and Agriculture 
produces a first draft of suggested harvest management decisions. It 
is the responsibility of the managing authority to decide how much 
weight is put on the different knowledge sources. The relevant minister 
has the final say and can overrule any harvest management suggestions 
made by relevant administrations.

Stakeholder consultation in harvest management 
The primary stakeholders are organized in the full time hunters’ or-
ganization (KNAPK), the organization for spare time hunters (TPAK), 
but the organization for the Greenland municipalities (KANUKOKA) 
is also involved. Other relevant agencies are the Ministry of Infrastruc-
ture and Environment, the Environmental and Nature Agency and the 
Greenland Institute of Natural Resources.  

The first draft of harvest management decisions is subjected to an 
internal hearing process through relevant departments within the Home 
Rule administration. Relevant corrections are made and the second 
draft is then presented to the Hunting Council, who provides recom-
mendations based on their discussion. 

The council consists of two representatives from KNAPK, one rep-
resentative from TPAK, and one representative form KANUKOKA. 
Based on the recommendations of the council amendments are made 
to the second draft. The third draft is hereafter subjected to an external 
hearing process though the KNAPK, the TPAK, the KANUKOKA and 
the Greenland Institute of Natural Resources.

Final harvest management decision
Upon receiving answers from the external hearing process, final 
harvest management decisions are made and approved by the Minister 
of Fisheries, Hunting and Agriculture. Upon signing by the minister, 
the harvest management decisions are presented in government, and if 
accepted the management decisions are published on the Home Rule 
website and through press releases. 

The Tulugaq campaign on sustainable use of the living resources
In 2002 – 2004 the Tulugaq campaign on sustainable use of the living 
resources was issued by the Home Rule Government. The aim of the 
campaign was to start a dialogue on the use of living resources in 
Greenland based on scientific knowledge and to thereby to secure a 
sustainable use of the 40 to 50 species generally hunted in Greenland. 

An important element of the campaign was to involve hunters along 
the coast in the dialogue on and improvement of sustainable use of 
living resources. Therefore seminars, meetings for local stakeholders 
and authorities, and public town hall meetings were held locally. At the 
seminars and meetings the need for both stakeholder involvement and 
improved cooperation between agencies and scientists was mentioned, 
as well as the need for a clear policy on the administration of licences 
for hunting quota managed species, and improved training for hunters.

As part of the Tulugaq campaign both folders and posters and a 
homepage with information on sustainable use of living resources was 
published, reaching out for both children and the general public. A se-
ries of factual folders was produced on 7 individual species; common 
eider (Somateria mollissima), Brünnich’s guillemot (Uria lomvia), 
Arctic tern (Sterna paradisaea), narwhal (Monodon monoceros), white 
whale (Delphinapterus leucas), walrus (Odobenus rosmarus), and 
polar bear (Ursus maritimus).  

8.5.5.2 Nature conservation
An area can be registered as a protected area by the Home Rule 
Government, but both local municipalities and non-governmental or-
ganizations working for the protection flora and fauna, can suggest for 
an area to be designated as protected. The Environmental and Nature 
Agency prepares a draft for the conservation of an area involving the 
stakeholders, and sees that the plans are advertised in the media at 
least two months before the conservation becomes effective. A plan 
for a conservation of an area must illustrate the purpose and the extent 
of the conservation, plans for monitoring and care, and details on the 
future management of the area. 
In the sections below attention is paid to the management of five 
protected areas with marine habitats.

The National Park of North and East Greenland
National Park management and monitoring is shared between authori-
ties in Greenland and Denmark: The Environmental and Nature 
Agency of the Greenland Home Rule, the Danish Defence (MRCC 
Groennedal and the Sirius Patrol) and the Danish Polar Centre in 
Copenhagen.

Access to the National Park
Access to the National Park and the Greenland Ice Sheet is regulated 
by the Danish Executive order on access to and conditions for travel-
ling in certain parts of Greenland, no. 1280 of 7th of December 2006, 
and guidelines on access, no. 113 of 7th of December 2006.  

The Danish Polar Centre administers access to the park for research-
ers and visitors, granting permits for any sailing in the National Park 
and travels of more than 24 hours duration in the land areas. Perma-
nent residents can, however, access the park area for ordinary traffic 
and travelling on the occasion of usual hunting and fishing activities 
without a permit. The application for travel permits in the National 
Park and areas regulated by the executive order must provide informa-
tion on travel route, supplies and equipment, planned activities etc. 
Conditions aiming at avoiding any rescue operation, such as travel 
restrictions in terms of time or geographical area, and the requirement 
of bringing emergency equipment, may be stipulated in the permit. 

As many researchers visit the National Park and the Greenland Ice 
Sheet valuable information on remote areas of Greenland are collected. 
Therefore, researchers, participants in expeditions and tours are asked 
to write a travel report.

During the application process the Danish Polar Centre hear the Green-
landic authorities, through the Environmental and Nature Agency, 
who involve other relevant institutions. When a project in the National 
Park or on the Greenland Ice Sheet may have consequences for the 
environment, an environmental operation permit is issued. In 2008, the 
Environmental and Nature Agency has issued environmental opera-
tion permits to a number of research projects, including the recovery 
of downed planes, ice core drilling projects and a traverse connecting 
research camps on the Ice Sheet. In the permit the storage of fuel and 
environmentally hazardous materials, the handling of waste and the 
clean up of the area is regulated. 

The Home Rule in 2008 prepared a report on the future administration 
of access to the National Park and the Greenland Ice Sheet. Recom-
mendations have been made to transfer the administration of access to 
the National Park and the Greenland Ice Sheet, as regulated by Chapter 
1 of the executive order, from the Danish Polar Centre to the Envi-
ronmental and Nature Agency of Home Rule Government as of 1st of 
January 2010. 

Protection of the National Park
Protection of the National Park is administered by the Home Rule 
Government. 

The Mineral Resources Act allows for exploration and exploitation 
licences to be issued for an area within the park, but the National Park 
committee can ask that measures are taken by the licence holder to 
protect the nature and wildlife of the National Park.  

Other activities within the park are regulated by the National Park 
government order. For instance fishery is only allowed by rod or pilke, 
and only the personnel at the stations in the park, e.g. the Sirius Patrol 
personnel, are allowed to hunt for seal, grouse and hare. Residents in 
the municipalities near the park, Qaanaaq and Ittoqqortoormiit, can 
engage in traditional activities like hunting using dog sledges, kayak or 
motorized boats. But hunters must report on their activities to the local 
authorities. And to protect the wildlife of the park mammals and birds 
may not be disturbed by visitors in the park. No eggs can be collected, 
and only dogs used for dog sledges may be brought into the park. 
Mineral resources activities in the National Park Mineral resources 
activities will not have a significant impact on nature protection in 
all parts of the park, but the Bureau of Mineral and Petroleum notice 
that there are vulnerable areas within the National Park. Exploitation 
activities may lead to long term conflict with nature and environmental 
considerations, but many conflicts can be reduced through the require-
ments laid down by the authorities in connection with approval of 
planned activities. 

Management of biological nature protection interests can be carried 
out using a model to designate biological protection areas – hot  spots  
– and buffer zones. Within the hot spots and buffer zones the National 

ICAS 
Attachment 3



78

Environmental Research Institute develop regulation mechanisms for 
activities that must be either regulated or excluded for periods of time 
where individual species are particularly vulnerable. 

The following initiatives are suggested with regard to mineral re-
sources activities in areas with a special need for nature protection: 
existing background knowledge must be much better than it is today; 
Environmental Impact Assessments must be carried out for the entire 
life cycle of an activity from exploration and exploitation to closure; 
and finally a computer-based GIS tool should be developed, integrat-
ing both nature protection interests and impacts from mineral resources 
activities.

The Strategy Plan for the National Park
In addition to conservation interests, there are other interests in the 
National Park area, e.g. economic interests in relation to tourism and 
the exploitation of mineral resources, traditional use interests and 
recreational interests. Due to the many interests a strategy plan for the 
National Park is being developed by the Environmental and Nature 
Agency in cooperation with the Bureau of Minerals and Petroleum and 
other agencies introducing zonation. 

As part of the Strategy Plan for the National Park, the Home Rule 
Government is developing zonation of the National Park to ensure 
conservation interests and prove opportunity for economic develop-
ment. In accordance with § 20, the National Park area can be divided 
into separate zones: zone 1) especially valuable and vulnerable, zone 
2) areas that are important and sensitive, zone 3) areas including a 
site of cultural, historical or natural interest, and finally zone 4) open 
water areas of ecological importance. The Home Rule Government can 
regulate access to and activities within these zones. 

Research institutions provide the background data on nature, geology, 
history and culture, and all relevant stakeholders are involved in the 
zonation process.

Management of the Ilulissat Ice Fiord
The Greenland Home Rule Government Order no. 10 of 15 June 2007 
on the protection of the Ilulissat Ice Fiord protects the scenic beauty 
and the natural historic, cultural historic and other values of the area. 
The 2007 government order replaced a less restrictive government 
order, no. 7 of 25th of March 2003. 

In the government order zonation is applied in protection and manage-
ment. The area is divided into one land zone – zone A – and two 
marine zones – zone B and zone C – as illustrated in Fig. 12. Restric-
tions apply to activities in zone A, but the area is open to the public 
and visited by many guests each year. In zone B navigation is pro-
hibited, except for navigation in connection with commercial fishing 
and hunting and search and rescue operations. And in zone C access 
is restricted to vessels smaller than 1.000 GRT. Tourist operators must 
bring guides with knowledge of the regulations protecting the flora and 
fauna of the Ilulissat Ice Fiord when travelling in the protected areas. 

The Ilulissat Ice Fiord was accepted as a UNESCO World Heritage 
area in 2004. Therefore a management plan for the Ilulissat Ice Fiord is 
currently being developed. The purpose of the management plan is to 
protect the area by various actions. Ilulissat Kommunea, the munici-
pality, monitors the area while the authority lies in the Environmental 
and Nature Agency of the Greenland Home Rule. 

Commercial Greenland halibut fishing by small vessels is intensively 
conducted in the Ilulissat Ice Fiord and the annual halibut quota is 
determined by the Greenland Home Rule. The annual quota is deter-
mined by biological guidance presented to the Ministry of Fisheries, 
Hunting and Agriculture, Greenland Home Rule. 

Management of the nature reserve of Melville Bay
The nature reserve is administered by the Environmental and Nature 
Agency of the Home Rule Government. 

In the nature reserve access and activities are regulated. Travel by land 
or boat, air travel in altitudes below 500 meters, and hunting, fishery 
and collection of eggs is prohibited. But like the regulation of the 

National Park, traditional hunting of marine mammals from boats or 
dog sledges is permitted in areas outside zone II. 

The only exception to the above is activities regulated by the Mineral 
Resource Act. Exploration and exploitation of mineral resources can 
be permitted, in accordance with § 9 of the government order on the 
nature reserve in Melville Bay.

Management of the Ikka Fiord
The Ikka Fiord is administered by the Environmental and Nature 
Agency of the Greenland Home Rule. Access to the inner Ikka Fiord 
is not regulated, but visitors are requested to assist in the protection of 
the columns and to travel carefully in the fiord. 

Management of the Kitsissunnguit Islands
The Home Rule Government order on the conservation of the Kitsis-
sunnguit Islands was adopted in 2008, but in the process that led to 
the conservation of the islands local hunters and fishermen, the local 
communities, and researchers were involved. The many interests in the 
area are reflected in the conservation as activities in the area are regu-
lated by zones, seasons and activities. By inclusion of interests and the 
detailed zonation and regulation the Home Rule Government aim to 
receive local support for the conservation and to secure among others 
the population of Arctic tern and the rich biodiversity of the islands. 

The Kitsissunnguit Islands are still open to the public, but in spring 
and summer access is restricted to smaller groups and only to the area 
covered by zone 3, which covers the south-eastern islands. In the three 
zones of the conservation are no hunting, fishing or collection of eggs 
can be conducted from May till October, except for the fishery of one 
single species in zone 3 from 1st of May till 10th of June. 

The conservation is administered by the Environmental and Nature 
Agency, while the Ministry of Fishery, Hunting and Agriculture 
administer and control fishery and hunting. Local authorities in Qasi-
giannguit and Aasiaat observe the regulations in the area.

8.6 Conclusion: challenges in ecosystem-based 
oceans management
Elements of ecosystem-based ocean management have been intro-
duced, but an integrated ecosystem-based ocean management is still 
to be developed in Greenland. In the above passages the management 
and practices in fisheries, shipping and tourism, mineral resources 
activities, nature conservation and wildlife management is predomi-
nantly characterized as management by single species or activities with 
aspects of stakeholder involvement. 

In fisheries and wildlife management as well as in nature protection 
and conservation stakeholder involvement is decisive as stakeholders 
often bring important data to the management process. Furthermore, 
the involvement of stakeholders brings support to the implementation 
of protective measures, i.e. restrictions on access and activities. In the 
long process towards the conservation of the Kitsissunnguit stakehold-
er involvement was comprehensive. As a result of the dialogue diversi-
fied zonation protects vulnerable zones on the islands while leaving 
the islands open to the public too. The effects of the conservation on 
the health of the population of Arctic tern are still to be evaluated, but 
hopes are that restrictions are observed. 

The important success element in moving towards ecosystem-based 
ocean management is the achievement of sustainable use of resources. 

In wildlife management resources have been committed to implement-
ing a comprehensive plan on wildlife management, including aspects 
of ecosystem-based management. Furthermore, a working group is 
currently developing a strategy plan for the National Park of North and 
East Greenland introducing zonation in management. But in moving 
towards ecosystem-based management there is a need for both data 
and resources to secure a long term wildlife monitoring.

The main obstacle is the lack of a national strategy for the use of 
ecosystem-based management in Greenland, including the lack of a 
national strategy for nature conservation and species management.

There is a need to develop desired aims for nature conservation and 
species management in line with international conventions and na-
tional policies. 

Furthermore, there is a need to develop a strategy and a long term plan 
for monitoring. A cost effective monitoring strategy which ensures the 
best possible basis for management decisions using a variety of moni-
toring methods, i.e. scientific methods, harvest statistics, local based 
monitoring etc, must be developed. As described in the above sections 
stakeholder involvement is practiced in management, but in general 
eco-systems based management is challenged by the lack of a strategy 
on stakeholder involvement and the use of stakeholder information in 
the management process.

Guidelines on ecosystem-based management in all relevant sectors are 
also to be developed. Central to these guidelines are elements such as 
management aims, monitoring plans, stakeholder involvement, data 
requirements, decision making processes and measures to ensure good 
collaboration between agencies.

1. Overview of Canadian Arctic

1.1 Natural environment and oceanography
Canada’s northern coastline, including Hudson Bay and James Bay, 
has a total length of 180,000 km which counts for almost the three 
quarters of Canada`s total coastline and makes Canada the country 
with the world`s longest coastline. Over 1 million km2 of shelf waters 
occur within Canada’s 200-mile exclusive economic zone (EEZ). The 
Arctic coast is characterized by a wide variety of cold climate eco-
systems, including salt marshes, tidal flats, fjord systems, river deltas, 
and sea ice. The Arctic Ocean provides an important mixing function 
between Atlantic and Pacific waters and many scientists believe it to be 
a critical component in the global ocean circulation belt. The waters of 
the western Artic Ocean mix directly with warm waters arriving from 
the Pacific Ocean, while the waters of the eastern Arctic Ocean interact 
with the Atlantic. Currents flowing in and out of the arctic are thought 
to play a large role in determining global climate. For example, the 
Baffin and Labrador currents, carrying large amounts of freshwater on 
their surface from melting ice, help direct the warmer North Atlantic 
current towards northwestern Europe which moderates their climate.
Major arctic currents include the clockwise gyre in the Beaufort; the 
flow of polar water southeast through the Archipelago; the West Baffin 
Current, which carries ice south along the east coast of Baffin Island in 
summer; the counter-clockwise gyre in Hudson Bay; and the opposing 
eastward and westward tidal currents in Hudson Strait. Locally, the 
currents may maintain open water areas – polynyas – for much or all 
of the year. The largest of these, the North Water in north Baffin Bay, 
is large enough to allow an early and persistent phytoplankton bloom 
(Welch, 1995).  Marine mammals, such as narwhal and beluga that do 
not migrate south, remain in the polynya during the winter months.
Sea ice provides a birthing and weaning habitat for ringed seals, 
resting sites for walrus, and hunting grounds for polar bear. Arctic 
polynyas provide an oasis for a multitude of arctic species, including 
whales, seals, walrus and birds. The Canadian northern environment 
is considered harsh, and its ecosystems are fragile and vulnerable to 
perturbations and environmental forcers. The Arctic has long been con-
sidered the area where global climate changes will first be observed.
Freshwater input into Canadian arctic waters is primarily from the 
Mackenzie River and the Nelson River drainages, respectively, the 
second and fourth largest watersheds in North America. These drain-
ages carry some pollutants from agricultural, industrial and municipal 
areas into the north although the majority of contaminants in the 
north are still believed to be brought in via atmospheric long-range 
transport. The Mackenzie River carries important nutrients that make 
its delta and estuary one of the most productive in the Arctic. Naturally 
occurring mercury released from thawing permafrost is thought to be 
contributed to the Beaufort through the Mackenzie drainage. The long 
arctic marine food chains encourage the bio-magnification of any pol-
lutants, especially in top marine predators. Compared to other parts of 
the planet however, the Arctic Ocean remains relatively pristine. 

Canada’s North supports a variety of plants, birds, fish, mammals, and 
other species that have adapted and thrived under northern condi-
tions. Cliff shorelines, salt marshes, tidal flats, and estuarine areas 
provide the breeding, nesting and feeding grounds for colonies of 
seabirds. Most of the Arctic’s lower trophic species (e.g., zooplankton, 
arthropods, copepods, bivalves, and others) are wholly dependant on 
the abundance and distribution of the ice algae, kelp, and phytoplank-
ton. Important marine and anadromous fish species include arctic cod, 
several species of sculpin and arctic char. Invertebrate and fish species 
in turn act as forage for marine mammals including walrus and several 
species of seals and whales.

Seabirds and marine mammals are the main biological products of Ca-
nadian arctic seas. Arctic cod are key to the arctic marine food web. It 
has been estimated that 148,000 tonnes of cod are consumed annually 
by seabirds and marine mammals in the Lancaster Sound region alone. 
Arctic cod, amphipods, and herbivorous copepods are in turn eaten by 
millions of seabirds concentrated in Jones and Lancaster sounds, on 
the east coast of Baffin Island, and in Hudson Strait/northern Hudson 
Bay, where thick-billed murres, northern fulmars, black-legged kitti-
wakes, black guillemots, gulls, dovekies, and loons feed. The majority 
of these birds are colonial nesters on island cliffs, requiring special 
protection from disturbance during the nesting season. A diverse bird 
community uses coastal and offshore waters in the Beaufort Sea. Many 

species migrate long distances from wintering areas as far south as 
the Antarctic to breed and fledge young in high-latitude regions. Six 
major species groups are represented: ducks; geese and swans; murres 
and guillemots; gulls; terns and jaegers; loons; and shorebirds. Seabird 
abundance is lower than in the eastern Canadian Arctic, however the 
region provides critical habitat for Arctic ducks and geese. Critically 
important habitat for birds exists in both offshore and coastal areas 
(DFO, 2008).

Arctic cod and other prey also support several million resident ringed 
seals and less abundant bearded seals throughout the Arctic, along with 
migratory harp seals, beluga whales and narwhals in the eastern Arctic 
and beluga whales in the western Arctic. Walrus feed on clams and sea 
urchins throughout Hudson Bay and David Strait and in the high Arctic 
area of Baffin Bay near Jones and Lancaster sounds (Welch, 1995; 
DFO, 2008) 

Three discrete stocks of bowhead whales summer in Canadian waters, 
including populations in Davis Strait, Foxe Basin/northern Hudson 
Bay and the western Arctic. Bowhead whales filter-feed on zooplank-
ton, probably large copepods, chaetognaths, pteropods, and cteno-
phores Population size was most recently surveyed in 1993, with 8200 
bowheads estimated to be in the western Arctic stock. This comprises 
>90% of the world’s bowhead whales (DFO 2008). Bowhead whales 
have been harvested at the rate of one every two to three years in the 
eastern arctic. However, the eastern arctic harvest may increase sub-
stantially in the near future due to a continued rebuilding of that stock 
and new population estimates. There has been no harvest of bowhead 
whales in the western arctic since 1996. 

Genetic analysis has identified numerous stocks of beluga whales from 
the North American Artic, including seven stocks from Canada and 
four from Alaska. The eastern Beaufort Sea stock, the largest in Can-
ada, is thought to be well over 20,000 animals. Beaufort Sea belugas 
share common wintering areas in the Bering Sea with whales from 
several other stocks (DFO, 2008).

Polar bears have a circumpolar distribution, but they are not evenly 
distributed throughout the Arctic. Of nineteen discrete populations of 
polar bears in the Arctic, 14 occur in or are shared by Canada. Two 
populations have been identified in the eastern Beaufort Sea. Their 
distribution is determined by the presence and distribution of various 
types of ice cover, and by the distribution and abundance of ringed 
seals (DFO, 2008).

The immense size of the Arctic Ocean results in a variety of ecological 
features that vary from one region to another, depending on environ-
mental and climatic conditions as well as the direction of and distance 
from prevailing oceans currents.  Marine ecological regions (ecore-
gions) were delineated in Canada’s EEZ based on geological, physical 
oceanography, biological and ecological criteria to support the imple-
mentation of the ecosystem-based integrated management national 
approach (Powles et al., 2004).  Six ecoregions were identified within 
the Canadian Arctic Ocean (Fig. 1). The main ecological features that 
characterize each of these ecoregions are summarized here after:

 Arctic Basin Ecoregion
 This area, devoid of any shoreline, is generally characterized  
 by having depths >1000m.  The 200m depth contour close to the  
 adjacent High Arctic Archipelago ecoregion has been used to draw  
 the boundary between these ecoregions.  Much of the area is 
 covered by permanent ice which results in low primary production  
 and the quasi-absence of marine mammals and seabirds in this  
 eastern part of the Arctic Basin.  Very limited information is 
 available concerning fish and benthic communities (Welch 1995).

	Beaufort–Amundsen–Viscount Melville–Queen Maud 
 Ecoregion
 Most of the depths are <200m with some very shallow waters in  
 certain parts of the ecoregion.  The northern part is characterized  
 by pack ice, whereas seasonal ice predominates in the southern 
 part. A characteristic of this region is the shallow waters between  
 Viscount Melville and Lancaster Sound.  In the past, this feature  
 was associated with a permanent plug of ice that was thought to act  
 as physical boundary to the West-East movement of marine

 mammal populations (narwhals, belugas).  Permanent ice begins at  
 the northern edge of the ecoregion which also corresponds to a  
 general boundary for marine mammals and seabirds (Welch 1995)

	High Arctic Archipelago Ecoregion 
 This ecoregion is characterized by a high degree of enclosure due  
 to the number of islands and narrow straits with relatively shallow  
 waters. The entire region is covered by permanent ice which 
 explains its low primary production.  The ecoregion is also 
 characterized by a quasi-absence of top predators like marine  
 mammals and seabirds.  Seals are only observed in the southeastern  
 part of the Archipelago and the species distribution of seals was  
 used to determine the boundary between this ecoregion and the  
 Lancaster Sound Ecoregion.  There is also very limited information  
 on fish and benthic species inhabiting this region (Welch 1995).

	Lancaster Sound Ecoregion
 This ecoregion is characterized by depths <1000m.  It is a relatively  
 enclosed area covered by seasonal ice.  A large polynya starts at the  
 mouth of Lancaster Sound and extends northward along the Eastern 
 coast of Ellesmere Island. There are also several small recurrent
 polynyas in this region. The primary production of the region is  
 relatively high and abundant marine mammals (belugas, narwhals)  
 and seabirds migrate seasonally to the Sound and the Eastern coast  
 of Baffin Island (Welch 1995).

	Hudson Complex Ecoregion
 This ecoregion is formed by Hudson Bay, James Bay, Foxe Basin,  
 Hudson Strait and Ungava Bay and is characterized by a high  
 degree of enclosure.  Ice cover is seasonal and two major polynyas  
 have been observed in Hudson Bay and Foxe Basin.  These 
 relatively shallow waters are under the influence of important tides 
 and huge amounts of fresh waters coming from the eastern part  
 (Québec) of Hudson Bay control mixing.  Primary productivity is  
 relatively high, mainly in coastal areas, and supports a diversity of  
 fauna.  Ecological assemblages of seabirds and marine mammals  
 indicate that Hudson Bay, Foxe Basin and Hudson Strait are three  
 natural sub-ecoregions that may eventually be considered for 
 planning and management purposes (Welch 1995).

	Baffin Bay–Davis Strait Ecoregion
 This ecoregion is delineated eastward by the continental shelf  
 line, which separates it from offshore deep waters (> 1000 m). The  
 ecoregion is covered by seasonal ice in winter and is influenced by  
 tides and fresh waters.  Deep-water temperatures are relatively  
 colder than in the southern adjacent region.  Primary production is  
 relatively high, mainly in waters surrounding the northern and 
 eastern part of Baffin Island, and generally declines when moving 
 offshore.  Bottom water temperatures were used to identify the  
 southern boundary of this ecoregion because there is clear evidence  
 that this boundary corresponds to the distribution limits of   
 numerous species of shrimp, groundfish, marine mammal and  
 seabirds (Welch 1995).

1.2 Social and economic context
Northern Canada, that portion of Canada north of 60o, contains ap-
proximately 40% of Canada’s landmass, yet its population base was 
less than 0.3% of Canada’s total population of 31 million in 2003. The 
majority of northern communities are concentrated along the Macken-
zie River watershed in the Northwest Territories (NWT), and along the 
Hudson Bay and Baffin Island coastlines in Nunavut.

Oceans have been a dynamic growth sector for the Canadian economy 
over the last few decades.  In the Canadian Arctic, transportation 
(largely seasonal and local), oil and gas exploration, ecotourism, com-
mercial fishing and subsistence harvesting (i.e. fishing and hunting) all 
contribute to the ocean-based northern economy.  

The marine sector consists of private industries, organizations, and 
various levels of government that depend on the ocean environment 
as a medium for transportation, operation, innovation or recreation, or 
as a source of extractable resources. Impacts of the marine sector are 
substantial—about 5% to 10% of the total NWT economy and more 
than 10% of the Nunavut economy. Impacts in Nunavut are domi-

nated by the subsistence or traditional sectors with 170 tons of marine 
mammals and fish (edible weight) harvested in NWT and 1,450 tons 
of marine mammals and fish (edible weight) harvested in Nunavut.  In 
addition, subsistence has great cultural and social value and provides 
food, clothing, fuel oil and other necessities. The commercial fishery 
for Greenland halibut and shrimp in the Baffin Bay-Davis Strait-Hud-
son Strait areas generate in excess of $12-14 million to the economy 
of Nunavut with approximately $7.5-9.5 million entering the wage 
economy (Brubacher Development Strategies, 2004). The seabed 
holds substantial offshore oil and gas reserves. There is also a growing 
industry surrounding arts and crafts, e.g. Inuit sculpture.  

There is not a comparable marine sector in Yukon as the northern 
marine coastline of this Territory is largely unpopulated. However, 
ecotourism has had an enormous impact in Yukon, particularly in the 
increased number of tourists to Herschel Island Territorial Park and 
Ivvavik National Park. It is expected that the marine sector will play 
an enhanced role in the Yukon economy as future offshore oil and gas 
activities increase.

1.2.1 Public sector, including Aboriginal Governments and 
Communities
Public governments, both federal and territorial, are some of the larg-
est investors in Canada’s northern territories. The federal government 
is one of the largest single sources of expenditures made in the North 
(GSGislason & Associates Ltd., 2003), and supports numerous man-
dated activities, including research. Federal departments with a strong 
presence in the North include the Department of Indian and Northern 
Affairs Canada (INAC), Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO), 
Transport Canada (TC), Environment Canada (EC), Parks Canada 
Agency (PCA), and Department of National Defence (DND).

Territorial departments with responsibility for fish and wildlife include 
Environment and Natural Resources in the NWT, and Economic 
Development (Fisheries and Sealing Division) in Nunavut.  In addi-
tion, Inuit co-management and economic development activities are 
addressed under land claims agreements (GSGislason & Associates 
Ltd., 2003). The federal government has devolved responsibility for 
all programs and services, including land and resources, to the Yukon. 
Yukon’s Department of Environment has responsibility for fish and 
wildlife and its Department of Energy Mines and Resources has 
responsibility for onshore oil and gas.

Aboriginal governments and communities in the territories have man-
agement responsibilities as well. Land claims settlements in the ter-
ritories have also provided governance structures. For example, under 
the 1984 Inuvialuit Final Agreement (IFA), the Inuvialuit received sub-
stantial management and co-management responsibilities for marine 
mammals, fish and wildlife in the Inuvialuit Settlement Region (ISR) 
of the Western Arctic. The 1993 Nunavut Land Claims Agreement 
(NLCA) was central to the creation of Nunavut as a territory on April 
1, 1999 and includes provisions for resource co-management. Each 
territory has a variety of aboriginal economic development agencies to 
guide and enhance economic opportunities. (GSGislason & Associates 
Ltd., 2003). In Yukon, 11 out of the 14 First Nations have negotiated 
land claims and self-government agreements and have responsibility 
for economic development within each of their jurisdictions. 

1.2.2 Private sector
The important private sector components differ in Canada`s three terri-
tories: the oil and gas industry is the major private sector marine sector 
in NWT; arts and crafts, fisheries, and shipping are the major private 
sector marine industries in Nunavut, and commercial ecotourism is the 
main private marine activity occurring along the Yukon coast.

Oil and Gas industry
The North is estimated to hold approximately 30% of Canada’s 
remaining potential in oil and natural gas, or about 8.7 billion barrels 
of oil and 163 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. The Mackenzie Delta-
Beaufort Sea hydrocarbon basin in the Western Arctic is estimated to 
hold 67% of northern potential for oil, and 36% of northern potential 
for natural gas. Two-thirds of this total is offshore (Voutier, 2008).

Challenges to the development of this sector include responding to 
regulatory requirements, meeting community expectations, addressing 
environmental concerns, ensuring requirements for infrastructure are 
met, and financial considerations. Legislation such as the Canadian 
Environmental Assessment Act (CEAA) and the Species-at-Risk Act 
(SARA) have introduced additional standards that impact performance 
requirements for all aspects of oil and gas exploration and develop-
ment. The Yukon Environmental and Socio-Economic Assessment Act 
(YESSA) applies to the Yukon shoreline and certain defined nearshore 
adjacent areas should future oil and gas activities onshore be direction-
ally drilled to offshore reserves. Typically, hydrocarbon development 
requires extensive seismic activity, drilling in coastal and offshore 
areas, the construction of artificial islands and pipelines systems, a de-
mand for granular deposits (i.e., gravel and sand), a dramatic increase 
in all-season and winter roads, marine shipping and aviation, and risk 
of pollution and oil spills. Development also results in an increased 
need for waste disposal and sewage treatment in communities and 
camps. Yet other challenges to industry will include addressing regula-
tory concerns related to impacts which might affect physical, chemical 
and biological patterns such as changes in water circulation and the 
introduction of aquatic invasive species (DFO, 2008; Voutier, 2008).

Fisheries
Commercial fishery potentials in true polar Canadian waters are small. 
The commercial fishery for arctic char is worth about $1.2 million 
annually; the domestic char fisheries have an approximate equivalent 
value. Greenland halibut, commercially called turbot, are found in 
deep Baffin Bay and Davis Strait waters in commercial quantities and 
support a successful shore-based winter fishery worth $1 million an-
nually out of Pangnirtung, south Baffin Island in Cumberland sound. 
Two species of commercially valuable shrimp (Pandalus borealis and 
P. montagui) are harvested from south Davis and Hudson strait waters. 
Scallops have been found off south Baffin Island and in Hudson Bay, 
although the commercial potential is probably small (Welch, 1995). 
The value of the offshore turbot and shrimp fishery to Nunavut is es-
timated at $7.5-9.5 million and provides more than 300 seasonal jobs; 
often in areas where few other employment opportunities exist.

1.3 Marine transportation
Marine shipping in the Canadian Arctic is growing steadily. Population 
growth is increasing the demand for deliveries of goods and materials. 
Northern communities have the highest rate of population growth in 
Canada, and one of the highest in the world: 16 percent per decade. 
The mining sector is another major user of marine transport in the 
Canadian North. Mining activity remains strong and is expected to 
grow. Development of oil and gas resources in the Mackenzie Delta 
will place additional demands on transportation. Canada is building up 
its marine transport capacity to be the primary means for supplying its 
communities and resource development activities in the North. Marine 
transport is now a stable, independent commercial sector (Oceans 
Futures, 2006). 

Given the changing climate it is expected that the ice will continue to 
retreat farther from coastlines in summer, that it will break up earlier 
and freeze up later, and will become thinner and more mobile. There 
is a growing expectation that the reduction in sea ice will result in 
longer navigable seasons, which in turn will allow increased access to 
northern natural resources, and therefore increased economic activity. 
However, a reduction in sea ice increases the risk of shipping accidents 
and spills associated with an increased volume of shipping traffic. The 
Northwest Passage (NWP) may also experience some ice-free periods 
during which navigation would become relatively easy, opening 
the possibility of the use of the Arctic as an efficient shipping route 
between the northern Atlantic and Pacific Oceans (Brigham and Ellis, 
2004).

Legislation, governance and management 
Management of activities within Canadian marine waters has largely 
developed on a regional basis and is therefore diverse and not always 
as integrated and coordinated as it should be. For example, there are 
about 50 federal statutes directly affecting oceans activities and >80 
provincial laws affecting coastal and marine planning (Mageau et al. 
in press). The Oceans Act (1996) was enacted to address this issue 
and facilitate the development of a coordinated approach and policy 

framework to integrated ocean management in Canada.
Many areas of Canada’s North are managed though agreements 
between the federal and territorial/provincial governments. As well, 
Canada’s north is managed under agreements negotiated with the 
Aboriginal residents. This new generation of treaties in Canada began 
with the James Bay and Northern Quebec Agreement of 1975. They 
are referred to as Comprehensive Land Claim Agreements (CLCA). 
These agreements spell out the nature of the arrangement between the 
Government of Canada and Aboriginal groups regarding such areas as 
self-government powers (including control over social services such as 
education and health), compensation payments, environmental assess-
ment, protected areas, land use regulations, and Aboriginal ownership 
or co-management of land and resources in parts of the land under the 
agreement (Berkes, 2007).

Land claims agreements in Canada, including the Inuvialuit Final 
Agreement and the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement, set up power and 
responsibility sharing arrangements for the use of land and resources, 
including marine resources. Many of the agreements have one or more 
chapters that do this in some detail. They all set up co-management 
bodies where the parties to the agreement come together (Berkes, 
2007).

Legislation aimed at protecting Arctic marine ecosystems and address-
ing conservation issues includes Federal, Territorial and Provincial 
legislation. Federal acts include the Oceans Act, the Arctic Waters 
Pollution Prevention Act, the Canada Shipping Act, 2001, the Fisher-
ies Act, the Canada National Marine Conservation Areas Act, the 
Canada National Parks Act, the Canadian Environmental Protection 
Act, 1999, the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, the Canada 
Wildlife Act, the Migratory Birds Convention Act, 1994, and the Spe-
cies at Risk Act.

The main Federal authorities which have responsibilities in the man-
agement of activities, and protection of marine ecosystems and their 
resources in the Arctic include the following:

	Department of Fisheries and Oceans (DFO): 
 DFO has the legal responsibility to conserve fish habitat and  
 commercial stocks in Canada under the Fisheries Act and by so
 doing it discharges some of Canada’s national and international  
 obligations to maintain the integrity of arctic marine ecosystems.  
 Under the Oceans Act, DFO is mandated to protect and conserve  
 marine ecosystems, their biodiversity and productivity, including  
 the establishment of marine protected areas (MPAs), and maintain  
 marine environmental quality, while promoting the integrated  
 management of human activities and sustainable development in  
 Canada’s estuarine, coastal and marine environments, including in  
 Arctic waters.

	Canadian Coast Guard (CCG): 
 CCG is a National Special Operating Agency of the Department of  
 Fisheries and Oceans that provides essential marine safety and  
 environmental protection services to Canadians. The CCG   
 also provides the marine support needed by DFO and other federal  
 government departments for the protection of the marine and  
 aquatic environment, public safety and security on the water,  
 marine science and fisheries resource management and to meet  
 other Government of Canada maritime objectives.

	Environment Canada (EC): 
 EC has the mandate to preserve the quality of the natural   
 environment; conserve Canada’s renewable resources and   
 biological diversity, as well as carry out meteorology and ice  
 services, prepare for and prevent environmental emergencies, and  
 report on the state of the environment. EC is also authorized to  
 manage and regulate the introduction of pollutants into the marine  
 environment, under the Canadian Environment Protection Act, and  
 section 36 of the Fisheries Act. The multi-faceted pollution 
 prevention effort in northern waters also includes controls on  
 disposal at sea and pollution from land-based sources. The 
 Department’s responsibilities pertaining to the conservation and  
 management of migratory birds under the Migratory Birds   
 Convention Act extend to the conservation and management of  
 Arctic seabirds. The Species at Risk Act provides the Minister  

ICAS 
Attachment 3



85

 of the Environment with the authority to protect nationally listed  
 wildlife species at risk, and provide for the recovery of endangered  
 or threatened species. The Canada Wildlife Act enables the Depart 
 ment to establish Migratory Bird Sanctuaries, National Wildlife  
 Areas, and Marine Wildlife Areas to protect a wide diversity of  
 habitat of national and international importance.

	Parks Canada Agency:  
 This federal agency, which reports to the Minister of Environment,  
 is mandated to protect and present nationally significant examples  
 of Canada’s natural and cultural heritage, and to foster public un 
 derstanding, appreciation and enjoyment of these special places.  
 This includes establishing representative systems of national parks,  
 national historic sites and national marine conservation areas. As  
 such, national marine conservation areas, as well as coastal and  
 marine components of national parks are an important component  
 of environmental protection in the Canadian Arctic.

	Transport Canada (TC):  
 TC is responsible for oceans safety and pollution prevention. It  
 administers the provisions of the Canada Shipping Act which  
 include regulation of navigation, as well as ship source pollution  
 prevention, including control of ballast waters. Transport Canada  
 is also responsible for the Navigable Waters Protection Act, the  
 Arctic Waters Pollution Prevention Act and the Marine Liability  
 Act, all of which have implications for shipping in the Arctic.

	Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC):  
 INAC is the principal federal department responsible for meeting  
 the federal government’s constitutional, political and legal respon 
 sibilities in the North, with legislative and policy authority over 
  most of the North’s natural resources, Yukon and  Aboriginal  
 governments. Its role in the North is extremely broad and includes 
 settling and implementing land claims, negotiating self-government  
 agreements, advancing political evolution, managing natural 
 resources, protecting the environment and fostering leadership in  
 sustainable development both domestically and among circumpolar  
 nations.

In the following sections, we detail the legal and policy framework 
as well as major national initiatives that have been put in place by 
the Government of Canada to implement the ecosystem approach to 
integrated management in Canada’s three oceans, including the Arctic 
Ocean.

Oceans Act
The Oceans Act (1996), which entered into force in 1997, is really 
the starting point for Canada’s Federal Government to develop a 
nationally coherent oceans policy framework. The Act provides the 
broad context for the development of an ecosystem approach for ma-
rine ecosystem conservation, and stresses the importance of maintain-
ing biological diversity and productivity in the marine environment.  
The Act provides a mandate to develop related programs and regula-
tory instruments; e.g. integrated management of human activities in 
oceans, designation of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs), and to develop 
tools to maintain the marine environmental quality (e.g. MEQ objec-
tives, guidelines or standards). Department of Fisheries and Oceans 
is the lead federal Department for implementing all the Oceans Act 
programs and instruments.

Canada’s Oceans Strategy and the Integrated Management  
Policy
In addition, the Act calls for the development of an overarching  
strategy for oceans management: Canada’s Oceans Strategy (COS,  
2002a) was developed after a broad public consultation process and  
is based on the three key principles: integrated management, 
sustainable development and precautionary approach. Its overall goal 
is “to ensure healthy, safe and prosperous oceans for the benefit 
of current and future generations of Canadians” (COS, 2002a). The 
Strategy’s companion document (COS, 2002b) provides the policy 
and operational framework for integrated management (IM) of human 
activities in Canada’s oceans and coastal areas. EBM and ecosystem 
conservation are core principles within the IM approach.

Federal Marine Protected Areas Strategy
The Oceans Act also calls for the establishment of a national network 
of marine protected areas (MPAs). In order to guide the building of 
this network, the Federal MPA Strategy was released in 2005 (FMPAS, 
2005).  It provides the direction to the three federal partners that have 
legislative authority in marine conservation, DFO (Oceans Act MPAs), 
DOE (Marine Wildlife Areas) and Parks Canada Agency (National 
Marine Conservation Areas), to develop a more systematic approach 
to marine protected areas planning and establishment in Canada, by 
using a rigorous and knowledge-based approach to site selection while 
maximizing ecological output.

For example, a number of protected areas which contribute to the over-
all protection of coastal and marine wildlife and habitats are in place 
or contemplated in the Canadian North. With respect to the federal 
authorities, these include:

 Seven of Canada’s 42 national parks established under Parks  
 Canada’s legislation are located along Arctic waters and include  
 a coastal and/or marine component: Quttinirpaaq, Sirmilik, 
 Auyuittuq, Ukkusiksalik, Aulavik, Ivvavik, and Wapusk. In total,  
 these parks protect over 4740 km of coastline and 6870 km2 of  
 marine waters.

 Nine of Parks Canada’s 29 marine regions are found in Arctic  
 waters and each of these will eventually be represented by a  
 national marine conservation area (NMCA). Though no NMCAs  
 have yet been established in the Arctic, discussions are underway  
 with the Government of Nunavut and Inuit organizations to initiate  
 a feasibility study for an NMCA in Lancaster Sound (Figure 1).

 Fourteen Migratory Bird Sanctuaries and 2 National Wildlife Areas  
 established under Department of Environment’s legislation are 
 located along the Arctic coast and protect and 13,500 km2 of marine  
 waters. A number of candidate National Wildlife Areas are also  
 underway (Niginganiq, Qaqulluit and Akpait, all along Baffin  
 Island) which will add approximately 4500 km2 of protected marine  
 waters.

 One Marine Protected Area (MPA) located in the Canadian   
 Beaufort Sea, the Tarium Niryutait MPA, is currently in the   
 process of being designated as such under the Oceans Act. Fisheries
  and Oceans Canada is leading the process. The candidate MPA  
 consists of 3 separate coastal areas: Shallow Bay, East Mackenzie  
 Bay near Kendall and Pelly Island and Kugmallit Bay, collectively  
 referred to as the Tarium Niryutait MPA which will protect one of  
 the world’s largest summering population of Beluga whales and its  
 habitat. This area is also a productive ecosystem with habitat unique  
 to the region and numerous species (ringed seal, bearded seal, polar  
 bear, fish, seabirds and coastal waterfowl (over 130 bird species).  
 The MPA covers approximately 1800 km2.

Oceans Action Plan (2005-2007) and the Large Ocean Man-
agement Areas (LOMAs)
In 2004, the Government of Canada committed to a two-year funded 
(2005-2007) Oceans Action Plan (OAP) to achieve a series of delivera-
bles grouped under four thematic pillars: 1) International Leadership, 
Sovereignty and Security, 2) Integrated Management for Sustainable 
Development, 3) Health of the Oceans and 4) Ocean Science and 
Technology (OAP, 2005).  A number of key deliverables identified 
within pillars 2 and 3 of the Plan were to advance the EBM approach.  
In addition to the designation of a number of MPAs, the Plan identified 
five priority Large Ocean Management Areas (LOMAs) in Canada’s 
three oceans (Figure 2): Eastern Scotian Shelf Integrated Management 
area; Gulf of St.Lawrence Integrated Management area; Placentia 
Bay-Grand Banks Integrated Management area; Pacific North Coast 
Integrated Management area; and Beaufort Sea Integrated Manage-
ment area. These LOMAs have served as pilots to test and apply 
science-based management tools specifically developed for advancing 
and implementing EBM.

Integrated management in the Beaufort Sea has been implemented as a 
collaborative planning process led by the Department of Fisheries and 
Oceans (DFO) to address oceans management issues in the Beaufort 
Sea LOMA, including the coastal, estuarine, Arctic islands and off-

ICAS

shore areas, and when appropriate collaborate with on-shore manage-
ment activities. Later in this chapter, we will focus on the Beaufort 
Sea LOMA as it is currently the only management area located in the 
Arctic Ocean.

Health of the Oceans (2007-2012)
In 2007, the Government of Canada launched a 5-year oceans plan, the 
so-called Health of the Oceans agenda to take over the 2005-07 OAP. 
This new oceans agenda will enable DFO to continue to work with its 
federal, provincial, territorial, Aboriginal, ENGOs and international 
partners for advancing the ecosystem approach to oceans management 
in Canada, with a focus on the protection and conservation of marine 
ecosystems; for example, the designation of new MPAs to progres-
sively build Canada’s network of MPAs; advancement of the Regional 
Strategic Environmental Assessment concept by integrating assess-
ment tools developed for ocean management (i.e. at regional/LOMA 
level) with project-specific impact assessments conducted under the 
CEAA for major projects in Canada, including the Arctic; and enhanc-
ing Canada’s capacity for oil spill responses, particularly in the Arctic. 
The existing five LOMAs will continue to provide the spatial manage-
ment context within which this new ocean agenda will focus over the 
next five years.

2. Ecosystem-Based Ocean Management Initiatives

2.1 National scale: the Ecosystem-Based Management 
operational framework
Definition and guiding principles
In the Canadian context, Ecosystem-Based Ocean Management in-
volves managing human activities in such a way that marine ecosys-
tem health is not significantly impacted. EBM is made operational, 
and its achievement becomes possible and measurable, when the 
significant components or the ecosystem (areas, species, properties) 
are identified as conservation priorities that, in turn, are translated into 
ecosystem conservation objectives to define the bounds within which 
the sustainable development can be achieved.

This operational definition is aligned with a series of guiding 
principles: EBM is holistic and cross-disciplinary, based on the best 
knowledge available, a phased implementation process, nationally 
developed and regionally implemented, area-based, objective-based, 
applied within the broader context of Integrated Management, incorpo-
rates the precautionary approach and adaptive management principles.

In practice, ecological considerations are taken into account at each 
step of the integrated management process in order to achieve scientifi-
cally defensible ecosystem-based management and ensure long-term 
marine conservation (Fig. 3; shaded boxes).  Science-based manage-
ment tools have been developed over time to meet specific manage-
ment needs as identified at each step of the process. The result is the 
EBM framework presented in Figure 4. Some elements of this frame-
work set the foundation for both marine spatial planning and an area-
based management approach (ecoregions, Large Ocean Management 
Areas, Ecologically and Biologically Significant Areas, in addition to 
Marine Protected Areas) and are detailed in the following paragraphs.

	Marine Ecoregions
 The first step is the delineation of marine ecological regions, i.e.,  
 those regions of the oceans that are characterized by large-scale  
 ecological features.  The intent is to use these features for the  
 establishment of LOMAs so that ecosystem considerations can  
 be accounted for in the planning, decision-making and management  
 of these areas.  The delineation process is guided  by science-based 
 criteria for the identification of patterns of ecological homogeneity  
 (ecoregions), as well as major discontinuities between them (Powles 
 et al., 2004). This process resulted in the delineation of seventeen  
 marine ecoregions in Canada’s three oceans: four  ecoregions in the  
 Pacific Ocean, seven in the Atlantic Ocean and six in the Arctic. 
  The six Arctic ecoregions are the largest and, as a whole covered 
 a larger area than the Pacific and Atlantic ecoregions (Fig. 1).  
 Indeed, limited data in certain regions of the Arctic did not allow
 scientists to identify smaller ecological units. In addition, some 
 very large basins work as a single ecosystem, and so were   
 considered as one ecoregion.

	Large Ocean Management Areas
 Ecoregions’ boundaries are not definitive and can be revisited  
 when and where needed as more scientific knowledge is gathered, 
 mainly in data-poor areas. It is also important to note that LOMA  
 boundaries are drawn using a mix of ecological and administrative
  considerations (COS, 2002b). Consequently, LOMA boundaries  
 are not expected to perfectly follow the natural patterns observed in  
 the marine environment, although ecoregions are the foundation
  layer for their establishment. In addition, the scale at which the  
 delineation process is conducted is an important issue. For example,  
 during the marine ecoregion delineation process, natural   
 substructures were identified within certain ecoregions (Powles et  
 al., 2004); these substructures were observed at a scale too fine to  
 be useful for the identification of large ecoregions and LOMAs. 
 However, ecoregions’ substructures would certainly be the best  
 spatial units for informing the identification of management areas  
 at smaller scale, and so coping with local environmental issues, e.g.  
 coastal management areas (COS, 2002b).

	Ecosystem Overview and Assessment Report
 Once the integrated management area is established, oceans   
 planners, managers and stakeholders need to be provided with the  
 ecological information relevant to EBM (Fig. 3; step 2). The best 
 available knowledge has to be incorporated from the outset of the  
 planning process to inform subsequent steps. It should come from  
 two main sources, the western science as well as local and 
 traditional ecological knowledge.

 The OAP (2005) identified a number of key deliverables to en 
 hance the knowledge and assessment of marine ecosystems and  
 help the identification of conservation priorities within the five  
 priority LOMAs: i) the preparation of Ecosystem Overview and  
 Assessment Reports (EOAR) for assessing and reporting on marine  
 ecosystems within the management areas; ii) the identification of  
 Ecologically and Biologically Significant Areas (EBSAs); and iii)  
 the development of Ecosystem Objectives for informing IM   
 planning in LOMAs.  These tools and products were really the  
 “building blocks” on which the EBM framework has been   
 developed in Canada (Fig. 4).

 A national guidance document for the preparation of Ecosystem  
 Overview and Assessment Reports (EOAR) was developed (Fig. 3  
 & 4; step 2).  The EOAR is based on a preliminary review of  
 current ecological knowledge.  The first part of the report is   
 descriptive and provides basic ecological information through a  
 series of thematic chapters. This part also includes an integrative  
 chapter on ecosystem relationships. The second part of the EOAR is 
 an integrated ecosystem assessment, based on the information  
 compiled and reported in the overview; it reviews human   
 activities—and associated stressors—that may have significant  
 negative impacts on the ecosystem, including an assessment of  
 potential cumulative impacts. It analyzes and evaluates the actual  
 conditions of the ecosystem’s health, highlighting which areas and  
 species managers should pay attention to, either because those  
 areas and species have a key role in the ecosystem, or because they  
 have been affected by human activities.  This ecological assessment  
 is the main source of information provided to guide managers in  
 setting conservation measures at the LOMA scale.

	Ecologically and Biologically Significant Areas
 The identification and mapping of “Ecologically and Biologically  
 Significant Areas” in each LOMA was guided by the framework  
 and criteria previously developed through a national workshop of  
 experts (DFO, 2004). The framework consists of three criteria 
 (uniqueness, species aggregations and fitness consequences) that  
 qualify an area as “significant”. In other words, they are the   
 dimensions along which a given marine area is evaluated with  
 regards to its ecological or biological significance. In addition to  
 these first order criteria, two additional criteria, the resilience and  
 naturalness may be considered when evaluating the significance of  
 the areas against the main criteria. These additional criteria allow us 
 to take into account the sensitivity of the area, its ability to recover  
 from a perturbation, and the degree to which the area is undisturbed.

 category of EOs will be identified by the IM “players”, ocean  
 stakeholders, users and planners, to define an agreed-upon state of  
 the ecosystem to be reached in a given future.  However, the 
 necessary condition to achieve the sustainable use of oceans space  
 and resources commands that those desirable targets be set within  
 the bounds of conservation limits. 

 Parallel to defining conservation limits, DFO is also working  
 with key partners to ensure that social, cultural, and economic  
 considerations are addressed.  Integrated oceans management, as 
 defined in the Canadian oceans policy context (COS, 2002b) is a  
 comprehensive, collaborative and inclusive process that enables us 
 to simultaneously take into account all these necessary aspects,  
 as well as the interdependencies of viable coastal communities,  
 marine  ecosystem health, and sustainable use of ocean resources. 
 Specifically, work is being done to use an interdisciplinary,   
 multi-partnered approach to creating a base understanding of our  
 coastal areas. This information will help to determine social, 
 cultural, and economic trends, pressures, vulnerabilities, and  
 opportunities. As a next step, relevant social, cultural and economic  
 objectives that respect ecosystem objectives and conservation 
 priorities will be developed (Fig. 3 & 4 step 4).

	Ecosystem Indicators
 Once incorporated into an IM plan, EOs will be monitored through  
 marine environmental quality or ecosystem health indicators.  Lists  
 of indicators can be easily found in the literature reviewing 
 integrated coastal/oceans management initiatives worldwide; (see  
 for example IOC, 2003).  The real challenge is to select the most 
 relevant indicators while keeping their number as low as possible 
 within effective suites of indicators that are workable and meet  
 the needs of integrated oceans management (IOC, 2006).  DFO is 
 identifying criteria and developing a framework to select the most  
 appropriate ecosystem indicators that would meet the common  
 needs of management sectors. A national suite of ecosystem   
 indicators will be then developed for meeting the various needs  
 of the management: to monitor and report on the status and trends  
 of marine ecosystems, to track key ecosystem functions, to assess  
 the effectiveness of management actions and to inform   
 decision-making.

	Adaptive Management
 Adaptive management is a key principle of the EBM/IM approach.   
 Based on lessons learned and best practices from the regional  
 implementation in LOMAs, the EBM  described above will be 
 refined over time, guidelines and products will be revisited when it  
 becomes necessary, i.e. when major science gaps are filled and 
 new ecological knowledge is produced, or when our understanding 
 of the EBM concept and the application of principles make   
 significant progress. Beyond science issues, adaptive management  
 may be also required in future if new priorities come up from  
 societal pressure or shift in the risk tolerance, or if we need to adapt  
 to changing environmental conditions.

	Sector-specific initiatives
  In addition to identifying significant components and conservation  
 priorities in LOMAs, ecosystem considerations have been also  
 inserted into sector-specific policy and regulatory instruments to  
 ensure those significant ecosystems are not jeopardized by human  
 activities and are timely and appropriately protected.  Sector- 
 specific initiatives are put in place for addressing emerging issues  
 or regulatory gaps in the domestic oceans policy framework. They  
 may be established for addressing both, national or regional issues,  
 as illustrated by the following examples:
 
 DFO’s Fisheries and Aquaculture Management sector is developing  
 a New Resource Management Sustainable Development Framework  
 which includes a series of new policies to minimize impacts of  
 fishing activities1; these policies deal with emerging fisheries,  
 forage species fisheries, sensitive benthic marine areas, the use of  
 precautionary approach, etc.

87

	Ecologically Significant Species and Community-Properties
 Similarly, national guidelines and criteria were developed to help  
 the identification of “Ecologically Significant Species” and 
 “Ecologically Significant Community-Properties” (DFO, 2006).  
 Criteria related to the importance of the trophic and structuring  
 roles of species within the ecosystem were identified: forage  
 species, highly influential predators, nutrient importing or exporting  
 species, primary producers and decomposers, and structure-
 providing species. These categories of species would qualify as  
 ecologically significant.  Here again, two additional considerations,  
 the rarity and sensitivity of the species, were identified as important  
 when applying the ecologically significant species’ framework.  
 Invasive species and toxic phytoplankton were also considered  
 within the framework, although in this case, their ecological signifi 
 cance resides in the fact that they can cause significant damage to  
 marine ecosystems. In this case, management actions aim at  
 controlling and limiting as much as possible their abundance and  
 dissemination in the marine environment.

	Degraded Areas and Depleted Species
 In a risk-based management context, oceans managers have to  
 adopt a greater-than-usual degree of risk aversion to areas, species  
 or properties that are more significant than others.  Ecosystem  
 features that have been affected by human activities to an extent  
 where they can no longer play their structural or functional roles  
 in the ecosystem have to be identified within ecosystem overview  
 and assessment reports. Degraded areas and depleted species are  
 those ecosystem components that are of concern from a 
 management perspective. Degraded areas, for example, altered  
 habitats, contaminated sites, eroded shoreline, areas of hypoxia, and  
 sites facing recurrent eutrophication, are those areas that would re 
 quire targeted management measures such as restoration or control  
 of pollution sources. Depleted species are those species for which  
 a scientific assessment is essential and a recovery strategy and full  
 protection may be required to ensure the survival of the species 
 or the population. Endangered and threatened species listed under  
 the Species at Risk Act are obviously part of this category. Depleted  
 stocks of commercial species may also be considered here as they  
 are of concern for integrated oceans management.

	Ecosystem Objectives
 Objectives for EBM, or Ecosystem Objectives (EOs), are then  
 developed around non-human components of the ecosystem 
 described above, and incorporated into IM plans along with other  
 objectives (Fig. 3 & 4; step 3).  The EO setting process has been 
 guided at the national level to ensure consistency across the 
 country, and has been done at the LOMA level to capture 
 ecosystem-scale considerations.  The fine-tuning of management  
 plans to address local and/or specific environmental issues will  
 require EOs to become operational by adding increasing specificity  
 into objectives statements.  It is expected that the set of ecosystem  
 objectives developed for the IM-LOMA plan, when fully   
 developed, will contain two categories of ecosystem objectives: 1)  
 objectives set for conservation purposes, and 2) objectives targeting  
 the desirable state of the ecosystem.

	Conservation Objectives and Limits
 Conservation-oriented EOs are associated with appropriate eco 
 logical indicators and thresholds defining the biological limit of the  
 system–those “conservation limits” that should never be   
 compromised or exceeded in order to ensure a healthy ecosystem  
 over time.  Conservation limits are reference points that set the  
 bounds of the system within which other management objectives
  should be established. Conservation objectives are solely based on  
 science, including traditional knowledge, and are developed from  
 the identification of conservation priorities (Fig. 3 & 4; step 3).  
 Conservation objectives have been developed in each LOMA  
 following the national guidance (DFO, 2007a).  The next step is to 
 make these ecosystem conservation objectives operational through  
 the LOMA IM plan, and manage activities accordingly to ensure the  
 objectives are met.

	Social, Cultural and Economic Considerations
 The establishment of “desirable state” EOs combines ecological 
 with social, cultural and economic considerations, in contrast to  
 science-based conservation objectives.  It is expected that this

Understanding the Beaufort Sea ecosystem
An ecosystem overview was drafted using the best available 
information for the area, drawing on scientific knowledge and TEK 
(DFO, 2008). This basic ecological information has been reviewed 
by co-managers, technical experts, partners, and communities. The 
report’scontent follows the standard Table of Contents developed for 
national consistency while taking into considerations regional spe-
cificities of Arctic marine ecosystems.  This document is considered a 
‘living’ document and will be updated periodically as more is learned.  
A companion plain language summary report has also been devel-
oped for distribution to the public (Schuegraf and Dowd, 2007).  It is 
intended to make both documents available via the internet.

In the Beaufort Sea, dominant physical processes include sea ice extent 
and duration; the Mackenzie River inflow which supplies nutrients, 
sediment, and warm freshwater to the Beaufort Shelf; and oceano-
graphic currents and upwelling driven by local and large-scale factors.  
Though there are at present no estimates of the size of the Arctic cod 
population in the Beaufort Sea, it is known that there are many food 
web linkages to Arctic cod, an important consumer of zooplankton 
and small fish, and prey for vertebrate consumers. This relationship 
emphasizes the critical role Arctic cod play in the Arctic ecosystem, 
and their significance could be an important factor to consider when 
forecasting impacts of climate change and increased development on 
the ecosystem of the Beaufort Sea. (DFO, 2008)

Assessing the state of the Beaufort Sea ecosystem
Within the assessment part of the EOAR (Table 1), some sections, 
in particular those dealing with ecologically significant areas and 
species have involved significant partner engagement.  One scientific 
workshop with experts from various fields and organizations docu-
mented what is known or hypothesized about the significance of areas 
and species of the Beaufort Sea.  As well, a community workshop 
involving representatives from various Inuvialuit organizations and the 
6 ISR communities was held to identify which areas were ecologically 
significant.  During this workshop traditional knowledge was recorded 
on maps.  As a follow-up, focus group sessions were also conducted in 
each of the communities with representatives from local organizations 
(e.g. youth, elders, hunters and trappers, renewable resources, parks) 
and TEK was once again documented. Findings from these consulta-
tions and previous work (e.g. Community Conservation Plans, oral 
histories, harvest studies) have been synthesized in Table 2.

Managing human activities in the Beaufort Sea
The purpose of this work is to develop and implement an IM plan for 
the Beaufort Sea LOMA.  The vision is to ensure the Beaufort Sea eco-
system is healthy, safe, and prosperous for the benefit of current and 
future generations.  The Inuvialuit Final Agreement (IFA) (Canada, 
1993) and the Oceans Action Plan (2005-2007) set the framework for 
a governance structure and the creation of a Regional Coordination 
Committee (RCC) for integrated oceans management in the Beau-
fort Sea.  The RCC is co-chaired by senior members of Canada’s 
Department of Fisheries and Oceans and the Inuvialuit Aboriginal 
Government In addition to the RCC, the governance structure for 
collaborative planning process is also comprised of a broader group 
of stakeholders who participate in a Beaufort Sea Partnership (BSP) 
to exchange information and ideas, and make recommendations to the 
RCC. Various Working Groups and a Secretariat conduct the day-to-
day work required to support the larger governance structure. The need 
for greater involvement of the national intergovernmental committees 
on oceans has become apparent as the regional governance structure 
evolves. Conservation objectives, along with social, cultural and eco-
nomic objectives have been developed in consultation with communi-
ties, partners and co-managers.  

Specifically, conservation objectives for Beaufort Sea LOMA focus on 
maintaining marine biodiversity, productivity and habitats. To ensure 
these objectives are being met, responsible authorities will identify 
indicators and thresholds, and develop monitoring programs. Where 
possible these objectives and indicators are building on previous or 
current initiatives within the ISR such as the Tarium Niryutait Marine 
Protected Area, ISR Community Conservation Plans, and ongoing 
community-based and scientific monitoring programs. The Beau-
fort Sea LOMA integrated management plan will identify priority 
objectives and responsible agencies.  It will also outline strategies for 

	In 2006, Transport Canada released the Ballast Water Control  
 and Management Regulations under the Canada Shipping Act, 2001  
 to reduce the risk of harmful aquatic species being introduced into  
 Canadian waters through ballast waters; among other measures, the  
 regulations specify alternative ballast water exchange zones that  
 were defined based on a scientific basis.

	In 2005, the Government of Canada, in collaboration with the  
 Provinces of Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, and 
 British  Columbia, released the Statement of Canadian Practice for  
 Mitigation of Seismic Noise in the Marine Environment2 to 
 formalize and standardize the mitigation measures used in Canada  
 with respect to the conduct of seismic surveys. These guidelines  
 are based on the scientific knowledge available and derived from  
 best practices.

	At the regional level, ecosystem-based fisheries management  
 measures include area closures for protecting fish stocks or non- 
 targeted species; for example off Eastern Scotian Shelf, two Coral  
 Conservation Areas have been closed to all fishing efforts since  
 2001 and coral conservation plans have been developed. These  
 conservation initiatives were complemented by the establishment  
 of The Gully Marine Protected Area located in the same ecoregion  
 and protecting the biodiversity, incl. species at risk, of a deep-water  
 canyon ecosystem.

1.1 Local and regional scale: The Beaufort Sea LOMA 
example

1.1.1 Regional implementation of the national framework
Prior to the current move toward ecosystem-based management of ma-
rine resources, DFO’s procedure for protecting the marine ecosystem 
began with management plans for individual stocks, the first step being 
stock assessment, followed by a fishing plan specifying total allowable 
catch (TAC). DFO has been working at these plans and presenting re-
sults to the joint management boards, which have not been able to con-
duct the research themselves. Plans for marine mammal stocks include 
the Canada/US Beluga Plan; the Beaufort Sea Beluga Management 
Plan; the Southeast Baffin Beluga Plan; the Eastern Hudson Bay Belu-
ga Plan; and the Western Arctic Bowhead Plan, which was precipitated 
in part by the political need to have some sort of management plan in 
place before taking bowheads in the Beaufort Sea (Welch, 1995). The 
implementation of an ecosystem approach will result in more effort to 
incorporate ecosystem considerations into sector-specific management 
in order to fully achieve the ecosystem-based management of oceans 
activities.

The Beaufort Sea LOMA is one of the five pilot areas in which an 
ecosystem-based integrated ocean management approach is being 
implemented (OAP, 2005), and the only one of these management ar-
eas that is located in Arctic waters.  It is also the only LOMA in which 
a co-management regime exists: The Inuvialuit Land Claim Agree-
ment for the Inuvialuit Settlement Region (ISR) was signed in 1984 
and both the Inuvialuit and the Government of Canada share resource 
management responsibilities in the land claim area. The following 
paragraphs describe in more detail how the national framework has 
been applied to the Beaufort Sea LOMA and the Arctic context.

Delineating the Beaufort Sea marine ecoregion and planning area
The biogeophysical characteristics of the Canadian Western Arctic are 
relatively well known compared to other Canadian Arctic areas and 
have been the base for identifying marine ecoregions (Powles et al., 
2004). The Canadian Beaufort Sea is one of the 6 ecoregions identi-
fied in the Arctic waters (see previous section). The boundaries for 
the Beaufort Sea LOMA were established by the Regional Coordina-
tion Committee, an interagency group which provides coordinated 
decision-making, oversight, direction and review for the development 
and implementation of an IM plan for the LOMA. The planning area 
encompasses the marine portion of the ISR (Figure 5) which partly 
covers the Beaufort Sea ecoregion and incorporates ecosystem-scale 
features, patterns and trends. Covering 1,514,746 km2, it is the largest 
of Canada’s five LOMAs.

achieving management priority objectives.  Adaptive management 
will underpin the IM plan, so courses of actions will be revised when 
objectives are not being met.

1.2.2 Stakeholder consultation process and governance aspects
EBSA identification in the Beaufort Sea LOMA presented a number of 
challenges. These included the need to incorporate traditional and local 
knowledge; a significant lack of scientific data; significant seasonal 
and geographic bias in existing data and a bias towards knowledge of 
species that are important to the communities for subsistence fishing 
and hunting. Workshops were held with the scientific and local com-
munities to help identify potential EBSAs. The areas identified were 
then evaluated and ranked against the criteria and guidance developed 
nationally (DFO, 2004). Results are presented on figure 6.  Significant 
species and community properties key to maintaining ecosystem struc-
ture and function were also identified for enhanced protection under 
Canada’s implementation of ecosystem-based approach to manage-
ment, here again following national guidance provided by scientists 
(DFO, 2006). Candidate species were identified through consultation 
with local community members and the scientific community (results 
are summarized in Tables 2, 3 and 4). More information and scientific 
rationale supporting these results can be found in the Beaufort Sea 
Ecosystem Overview and Assessment Report (DFO, 2008).

Aboriginal control over the environment in the land claims areas is in 
the form of independent and joint jurisdiction, with aboriginal rights 
and responsibilities legally specified. Each of the comprehensive 
claims agreements has a section or sections that specify responsibilities 
for fisheries and wildlife management, and creating co-management 
boards as the main instruments of resource management. The agree-
ments establish institutional structures in the form of management 
boards and joint committees. Some of the agreements specify the use 
of aboriginal traditional knowledge in the process of co-management 
(Berkes, 2007).

The experience in the North is that the development of co-management 
strongly parallels the emergence of aboriginal land claims.  Partner-
ships and participatory management, not only in fisheries and wildlife 
but in a range of areas–integrated coastal management, protected areas, 
ecosystem and human health, contaminants research, environmental 
assessment, climate change– follows increasing local and regional 
political power in the North emerging from self-government. These de-
velopments have led to the incorporation of local values, priorities, and 
traditional environmental knowledge as mechanisms for participatory 
decision-making (Berkes and Fast, 2005). More recently, the Regional 
Coordination Committee (RCC) referenced earlier was established as 
the primary governance body for the Beaufort Sea LOMA. 

2.2.3 Challenges and opportunities
The Beaufort Sea is subject to the harsh Arctic climate which is char-
acterized by extreme seasonal variability in environmental factors such 
as ice cover, temperature range, winds and river inflow (Carmack and 
MacDonald, 2002).  Although marine life is adapted to this extreme 
environment, these conditions certainly make the Beaufort Sea’s 
ecosystem vulnerable to human-induced stressors.  From an EBM 
perspective, two overriding challenges for the Beaufort Sea LOMA ex-
ist: a lack of knowledge of offshore areas and the entire area during the 
winter season; and the global nature of the major ecosystem stressors 
including climate change and contaminants.

There are also many exciting opportunities and successful experiences 
to report. These include the creation of the first Oceans Act MPA in 
Canadian Arctic waters, the Government of Canada/Inuvialuit Fisher-
ies Joint Management Committee (FJMC) for the co-management of 
several fish and marine mammal stocks, and collection of ecological 
knowledge through partnerships for scientific research and monitoring 
(e.g. Beaufort Sea Habitat Mapping Program, Beluga Harvest Monitor-
ing Program).  Relationships are being forged at all levels, from local 
to regional and international scale, through such venues as the Beau-
fort Sea Partnership, Arctic Council and International Polar Year. So 
far, this integrated, holistic and ecosystem-based approach to oceans 
management has been well received and supported by the people of the 
Beaufort Sea region.

2.3 Transboundary Cooperation and EBM
Canada has entered into various regional and bilateral agreements 
which aim to foster environmental cooperation across political 
boundaries. Agreements supportive of ecosystem-based management 
fall into two main categories: environmental protection and marine 
living resource conservation.

2.3.1 Environmental Protection
Cooperation in transboundary environmental protection has been 
facilitated through the Canada-Denmark Agreement for Cooperation 
Relating to the Marine Environment,I the North American Agreement 
on Environmental CooperationII and bilateral agreements relating to 
the environment with the United States and the Russian Federation.

Canada–Denmark Agreement for Cooperation Relating to the 
Marine Environment
While the Canada-Denmark Agreement, concluded in 1983, predates 
the emergence of the ecosystem approach in international law, the 
agreement nevertheless has a broad goal of protecting the marine 
environment in shared waters of the Nares Strait, Baffin Bay and Davis 
Strait. Parties agree to provide information and to consult over any 
works or undertakings which may create a significant risk of trans-
boundary pollution. Parties agree to cooperate in identifying appropri-
ate routing areas for vessels operating outside territorial waters. The 
agreement also pledges Canada and Denmark to ensure that instal-
lations engaged in exploration for or exploitation of seabed natural 
resources are constructed, placed, equipped, marked and operated so 
the risk of marine environmental pollution is minimized.

Annexes to the Agreement set out joint contingency plans for pollu-
tion incidents in the region. Annex A covers pollution incidents from 
offshore hydrocarbon exploration or exploitation and provides for 
exchange of information on agencies and officials responsible for pol-
lution emergency responses. Annex B, as amended in 1991, establishes 
a joint contingency plan for shipping incidents.III

North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation
The North American Agreement on Environmental Cooperation, 
concluded in 1993 by Canada, Mexico and the USA, established the 
Commission for Environmental Cooperation (CEC) and while the 
Commission has not specifically focused on the Arctic, it has facili-
tated various initiatives relating to Arctic biodiversity protection. In 
2003 the CEC through its Council adopted a Strategic Plan for North 
American Cooperation in the Conservation of Biodiversity (CEC, 
2003). The Plan established a framework for promoting cooperation 
in conserving North American regions of ecological significance and 
North American migratory and transboundary species. The Strategic 
Plan lists 14 CEC priority conservation regions of North America with 
two specific Arctic regions included, namely Arctic Tundra/Archipela-
go and Arctic Coastal Tundra/North Slope.

The CEC has facilitated and coordinated the North American MPA 
Network (NAMPAN) with an aim of identifying priority conservation 
areas (PCAs) that should be considered for protection in light of shared 
marine migratory species crossing national boundaries. Initial work 
has focused on identifying marine conservation areas in the Baja Cali-
fornia to the Bering Sea region (a.k.a. the B2B initiative) and a 2005 
report identified 28 PCAs including two in the Bering Sea ecoregion, 
specifically the Pribilof Islands and Bristol Bay in Alaska. (Morgan et 
al. 2005).

The CEC has also supported a project on Marine Species of Common 
Conservation Concern. An initial set of three marine species (Pacific 
leatherback turtle, pink-footed shearwater and humpback whale) 
were selected in addition to three terrestrial species for development 
of North American Conservation Action Plans (NACAPs). For the 
humpback whale, which may be found in Arctic waters, a NACAP was 
published in 2005 (CEC, 2005). The Action Plan documents exist-
ing research initiatives and threats relating to humpback whales and 
suggests various trinational actions such as sharing information among 
countries about sources and impacts of anthropogenic sounds and iden-
tifying the principal regions and time periods posing the greatest risk 
of ship strikes to humpback whales.

In 1999 the CEC launched the North American Bird Initiative (NA-
BCI) with an overall goal of enhancing cooperation among existing 
bird conservation organizations and initiatives to achieve effective 
protection of all North American birds.IV NABCI partners have deline-
ated ecoregions (Bird Conservation Regions) across North America, 
including the Arctic, with ecoregions defined by common biophysical 
elements, such as soil type, vegetation and associated bird species.V 
NABCI complements other international bird conservations efforts 
such as those under migratory bird treaties and the North American 
Waterfowl Management Plan (NAWMP 2004).

Canada–Russian Federation Agreements
Canada and the Russian Federation have cooperated in environmental 
protection pursuant to various agreements. The Canada-Russian Fed-
eration Treaty on Concord and Cooperation,VI  entering into force on 
April 4, 1993, sets out an overall framework for cooperation and in Ar-
ticle 10 specifically recognizes the need to protect fragile ecosystems.

The Canada-Russian Federation Agreement Concerning Environmen-
tal Cooperation,VII entering into force May 8, 1993, provided the legal 
foundation for establishing a Canadian-Russian Mixed Environmental 
Commission with a mandate to meet at least once every two years. The 
Commission is tasked with enhancing cooperation on a broad range 
of topics including atmospheric environmental issues, management 
of toxic chemicals, environmental technologies and conservation of 
ecosystems, including establishment of nature reserves, and protection 
of habitat and rare flora and fauna (emphasis added).

The Canada-Russian Federation Agreement on Cooperation in the 
Arctic and the North,VIII entering into force June 19, 1992, provided 
the legal basis for establishing a Canada-Russia Mixed Commission on 
Cooperation in the Arctic and the North with a mandate to meet at least 
once every two years. The Agreement lists priority areas for coopera-
tion which include, among others, land use planning and management, 
effects and transport of contaminants, fisheries science and technology, 
and northern policy and legislation.

The Canada-Russian Federation Agreement on Economic 
CooperationIX, entering into force on December 7, 1994, is aimed at 
promoting trade and investment cooperation as well as science and 
technology exchanges. Among the listed priorities for cooperation are 
energy (particularly oil and gas development and safety issues in nu-
clear power generation), mining, transport infrastructure and environ-
mental protection. The Canada-Russia Intergovernmental Economic 
Commission has been established to further cooperative collaborations 
and an Arctic and North Working Group has been specifically tasked 
with promoting bilateral promotion of sustainable Northern 
development.X

Canada–United States Agreements
Although Canada and the United States continue to disagree over the 
location of the ocean boundary in the Beaufort Sea and over the legal 
status of the Northwest Passage, they have facilitated limited envi-
ronmental cooperation through two key agreements. In 1977 Canada 
and the United States agreed to establish a joint marine contingency 
plan for the Beaufort Sea.XI The plan sets out regional contacts and 
procedures in case of spills of oil and other noxious substances and has 
been periodically revised most recently in 2003.XII The Canada-United 
States of America Agreement on Arctic Cooperation,XIII adopted in 
1988, is aimed at facilitating navigation of icebreakers in Arctic waters 
and encourages sharing of research information in order to advance 
understanding of the Arctic marine environment.

2.3.2 Marine living resource conservation
Cooperation in transboundary marine living resource conservation has 
been facilitated through the Agreement on the Conservation of Polar 
Bears,XIV the Canada-Greenland Memorandum of Understanding on 
the Conservation and Management of Narwhal and Beluga,XV the Con-
vention for the Conservation of Salmon in the North Atlantic Ocean,XVI 
and the Convention on Future Multilateral Cooperation in Northwest 
Atlantic Fisheries.XVII

Agreement on the Conservation of Polar Bears
Canada, along with Denmark, Norway, the Russian Federation and 

the United States, is a Party to the Polar Bears Agreement concluded 
in 1973. The Agreement in Article II recognizes the need for an eco-
system approach and the Agreement has been a catalyst for protecting 
polar bear habitats in Canada.  Article II provides:
 Each Contracting Party shall take appropriate action to protect the  
 ecosystems of which polar bears are a part, with special attention to  
 habitat components such as denning and feeding sites and 
 migration patterns, and shall manage polar bear populations in  
 accordance with sound conservation practices based on the  best  
 available scientific data.

Canada-Greenland Memorandum of Understanding on the Con-
servation and Management of Narwhal and Beluga
Through a 1989 MOU, the Department of Fisheries and Oceans of 
Canada and the Greenland Home Rule Government agreed to establish 
a Canada/Greenland Joint Commission on the Conservation and 
Management of Narwhal and Beluga (JCNB). At its tenth meeting held 
in Iqaluit, Nunavut, Canada, 9-11 April 2006, the JCNB recommended 
that an ecosystem-based approach be considered in the management of 
narwhal including interaction with its prey and predators.XVIII

In 2006, Canada moved to protect narwhal over-wintering grounds, 
including deep-sea corals in Southern Baffin Bay. The area is an 
important fishing ground for Greenland halibut, an important food 
source for narwhal. DFO’s Fisheries and Aquaculture Management 
sector decided to close a significant portion of the Southern narwhal 
over-wintering grounds to fixed and mobile gear fishing – as part of 
the 2006-2008 Fisheries Management Plan for Greenland Halibut in 
the Northwest Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) Statistical Area 
OA (DFO, 2007b).

Applying the precautionary approach, a key component of the ecosys-
tem approach, to narwhal and beluga harvests off West Greenland has 
been an ongoing challenge. In 2006 the JCNB expressed grave 
concerns over the high beluga harvest in West Greenland in light of 
scientific advice suggesting no more than 100 belugas per year should 
be taken to have an 80% chance of halving the decline in beluga 
numbers by 2010.XIX The West Greenland quota for 2006/2007 was 
fixed at 160 and increased to 165 for 2007/2008XX and 250 for 2008/
2009.XXI The JCNB also highlighted that the West Greenland narwhals 
are depleted to about one quarter of historical abundance and noted 
scientific advice suggested that total removal in West Greenland 
should be no more than 135 individuals.XXII The West Greenland 
narwhal quota for 2006/2007 was eventually set at 217 and quotas for 
2007/2008 and 2008/2009 were set at 300.XXIII There continues to be 
substantial disagreements between scientists and hunters over beluga 
and narwhal abundance.

Convention for the Conservation of Salmon in the North Atlantic 
Ocean
The Convention for the Conservation of Salmon in the North Atlantic 
Ocean (Salmon Convention), entering into force in October 1983, is 
relevant to Arctic waters since the Convention aims to conserve salm-
on stocks , migrating beyond areas of fisheries jurisdiction of coastal 
states, throughout their migratory range in the Atlantic  Ocean north 
of 36O latitude. Canada is a member of the North American and West 
Greenland Commissions established as regional forums for coopera-
tion and consultation in addressing the management of transboundary 
salmon populations. (Fig. 8).

Although Parties to the Convention have not explicitly adopted the 
ecosystem approach, they have emphasized the need to follow a pre-
cautionary approach and the need to protect and restore ecosystems on 
which salmon depend. Through the North Atlantic Salmon Conserva-
tion Organization (NASCO), the umbrella organization for regional 
cooperation, Parties forged a 1998 Agreement on Adoption of a 
Precautionary Approach (NASCO 1998) and a subsequent 1999 Action 
Plan for Application of the Precautionary Approach (NASCO 1999).

Recognising the numerous local activities impacting salmon habi-
tat, such as hydro-electric development, irrigation projects, forestry, 
land-drainage and pollution, Parties in 2001 adopted the NASCO Plan 
of Action for the Application of the Precautionary Approach to the 
Protection and Restoration of Atlantic Salmon Habitat (NASCO 2001).  
The Habitat Plan of Action sets out two overarching commitments, the 

ICAS

need by each Party and its relevant jurisdictions to establish salmon 
river inventories and the need to develop national salmon habitat 
protection and restoration plans. Each relevant jurisdiction is urged to 
apply the precautionary approach through habitat plan implementa-
tion by placing the burden of proof on proponents of potential habitat 
impacting activities. Coordination of national habitat plans to deal with 
transboundary issues is also urged.

The NASCO Plan of Action encourages national reporting. Parties are 
requested to report to NASCO on progress towards implementation 
of habitat plans “on an ongoing basis”. In 2005 Canada reported to 
NASCO on various measures being taken to protect salmon habitat 
including: establishment of a $30 million (Cdn) Atlantic Salmon En-
dowment Fund to support community groups in improving river habi-
tats and strengthening watershed planning; continuation of a national 
no-net-loss policy on fish habitat; and provisions under the Fisheries 
Act prohibiting harmful alteration or destruction of fish habitat unless 
authorized.XXIV

The International Atlantic Salmon Research Board has been estab-
lished to encourage and facilitate cooperation and collaboration on 
research related to marine mortality in salmon. The Research Board 
has initiated the Salmon at Sea (SALSEA) Programme to address its 
current priority, the migration and distribution of salmon at sea with 
particular reference to feeding patterns and predation, in order to better 
understand ecosystem factors contributing to salmon marine mortality. 
SALSEA is a broad, multi-year programme involving the coordination 
of existing research, as well as the development and implementation of 
new studies (NASCO 2004). 

Convention on Future Multilateral Cooperation in Northwest 
Atlantic Fisheries
The Convention on Northwest Atlantic Fisheries, of which Canada is 
one of 12 Parties, has to date played a minimal role in advancing 
ecosystem-based management in Arctic waters. Although the North-
west Atlantic Fisheries Organization (NAFO) has a management man-
date in the ‘Regulatory Area,’ defined as the Convention Area beyond 
the limits of coastal state fisheries jurisdiction, only tiny sections 
north of 60o in Statistical Division 1E and 1F (Fig. 9) fall within 
NAFO’s management jurisdiction. In light of the apparent absence of 
fisheries in these areas, NAFO has not so far imposed regulatory meas-
ures (Fischer, 2007). NAFO has, however, played an advisory role 
for stocks under its Convention occurring only in the EEZs of coastal 
jurisdictions of Canada and Greenland. 

NAFO is in the process of transitioning towards implementation of the 
ecosystem approach. At the 2007 Annual Meeting in Lisbon, Portugal, 
NAFO Parties agreed to major amendments to the NAFO Convention 
including a commitment to apply an ecosystem approach to fisheries 
management (NAFO 2007c). In light of the new ecosystem mandate, 
NAFO’s Scientific Council has established a Working Group on Eco-
system Approach to Fisheries Management and the Working Group has 
been tasked with identifying ecoregions within the NAFO Convention 
Area and with developing ecosystem health indicators (NAFO 2008a).

An Ad Hoc Working Group of Fisheries Managers and Scientists 
on Vulnerable Marine Ecosystems (VMEs) was formed in 2008 to 
complement the role of the Working Group on Ecosystem Approach. 
The Ad Hoc Working Group has been tasked with making recommen-
dations on effective implementation measures to prevent significant 
adverse impacts on VMEs (NAFO 2008b).

NAFO in collaboration with the International Council for the Explo-
ration of the Sea (ICES) has also established a Working Group on 
Deep-water Ecology (WGDEC). The Working Group has been active 
in studying deep water ecology in the North Atlantic and has identified 
coral distributions in the Baffin Bay/Davis Strait area (ICES 2008).

The NAFO Scientific Council Standing Committee on Fisheries En-
vironment (STACFEN) is continuing to assess the impacts of climate 
change on the NAFO Convention Area which includes Arctic waters. 
The 2006 NAFO Annual Climate Status Summary for the Northwest 
Atlantic highlighted various points including, among others:

 Annual mean air temperatures were above normal over the entire  
 NAFO Convention Area from West Greenland to the Gulf of Maine  

 with record high values occurring over Labrador and Southern Baf 
 fin Island.

	Sea-ice coverage in West Greenland waters, the Gulf of St. Law 
 rence and on the Scotia Shelf was lighter than normal.

	Warm ocean conditions observed during 2003 to 2006 off West  
 Greenland coincided with an increase in the production of haddock  
 and cod (NAFO 2006).

3. Conclusion
The legal context and policy framework to support ecosystem-based 
ocean management exist in Canada. A national framework and series 
of science-based tools have been developed to move from EBM con-
cepts and theory to a regional implementation. At the moment, EBM 
is not implemented everywhere in Canada’s oceans and current efforts 
are being applied in a limited number of priority management areas, 
the so-called LOMAs.  Full implementation of the ecosystem ap-
proach and adequate protection of significant components of Canada’s 
marine ecosystems, including the Arctic, will take time and additional 
resources due to the size and complexity of the marine environment 
under consideration. This is the reason why EBM is being imple-
mented incrementally in Canada. In this respect, and based on what 
has been reported in this chapter, we can reasonably say that Canada 
is “on track” in developing a nationally coherent science-based frame-
work, applying rigorous tools and conducting systematic assessments 
that set the foundation to an ecosystem-based oceans management. 
In the Beaufort Sea LOMA, which is currently the only management 
area located in Canada’s Arctic, EBM practices and tools are being 
developed.  It is still too early however, to observe tangible results and 
benefits from this new way to achieve ocean management.  Neverthe-
less, we expect that in the long run, EBM will ensure that Beaufort Sea 
marine ecosystem health is maintained as socio-economic develop-
ment occurs in this region.  The current approach will be refined and 
adjusted based on lessons learned during the development phase, 
progress in our ecosystem knowledge as well as evolving concepts. Al-
though the EBM approach and tools have been developed for domestic 
purposes and implemented in the Beaufort Sea, they could be exported 
to other areas eventually.

On the other hand, while the existing array of Canada’s transboundary 
agreements and arrangements in the areas of marine environmental 
protection and living marine resource management are supportive of 
the ecosystem approach, Canada has yet to fully develop and imple-
ment the ecosystem approach in transboundary governance practice. 
A network of marine protected areas has yet to be forged in the Arctic. 
An integrated planning approach has yet to be extended across national 
boundaries with the United States in the western Arctic and Denmark 
(Greenland) in the eastern Arctic.

In this respect, the application of Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs) 
concept to advance the ecosystem approach in the Arctic (AMSP, 
2004) will help address monitoring and assessment issues in interna-
tional shared waters to further manage based on ecosystem considera-
tions (see the LME section in USA chapter for background information 
on LMEs). Both approaches, the LME and Canada’s EBM have been 
developed consistently up to date and are complementary initiatives 
(Siron et al., 2008).  Using the LME approach is an effective way 
to bridge domestic initiatives and go beyond national jurisdictions. 
It provides the circumpolar community with a common spatial and 
governance framework that transcends political boundaries for interna-
tional or bilateral collaborations in EBM at larger regional scales and 
Arctic-wide.

decision-making processes that transcend traditional programmatic, 
agency, geographic, and jurisdictional boundaries.  The system was 
established pursuant to the US Ocean Action Plan of 2004. 

US ocean governance is organized under the Committee on Ocean 
Policy (COP).  The COP is a cabinet level body made up of numerous 
department heads and chaired by the Council on Environmental Qual-
ity (CEQ), located in the Office of the President.  The Executive Order 
that created the COP states that the purpose of the committee is to: 

1 Coordinate the activities of executive departments and agencies 
 regarding ocean-related matters in an integrated and effective  
 manner to advance the environmental, economic, and security  
 interests of present and future generations of Americans; and

2 Facilitate, as appropriate, coordination and consultation regarding  
 ocean-related matters among Federal, State, Tribal, and local  
 governments, the private sector, foreign governments, and   
 international organizations. 

To aid it in executing this mission, the COP has set up an ocean 
governance structure that includes the committees and subcommittees 
shown in Box 2 below.   

The two following sections will describe the roles of the Joint Sub-

committee on Ocean Science and Technology (JSOST) and the Sub-
committee on Integrated Management of Ocean Resources (SIMOR).    
  
 A. Ocean Research and JSOST
The initial tasks for JSOST were identifying research priorities and 
developing a strategy for responding to scientific challenges.  Work-
ing closely with the ocean research community, JSOST developed 
Charting the Course for Ocean Science in the United States for the 
Next Decade: An Ocean Research Priorities Plan and Implementa-
tion Strategy.  Released on January 26, 2007, this 10-year plan for the 
Federal role in ocean science is focused on ocean forecasting, scientific 
support for ecosystem-based management, and ocean-observing capa-
bilities, and identifies six major societal themes and 20 related research 
priorities (Box 3).  To initiate progress on the 20 research priorities, the 
plan promotes strategies for addressing four near term priorities: 
 
1 Forecasting the Response of Coastal Ecosystems to Persistent  
 Forcing and Extreme Events

2 Comparative Analysis of Marine Ecosystem Integration

3 Sensors for Marine Ecosystems

Introduction
This paper has been prepared in response to the Arctic Council’s call 
for descriptions of national experience in application of the ecosystem-
based approach to oceans management in the Arctic region.  In the 
United States, the development of ecosystem-based marine manage-
ment is national in scope and applied regionally.  Therefore, this paper 
describes the national approach.  In addition, the paper describes 
related regional initiatives that, over time, will interface with marine 
ecosystem-based approaches.  As well, the paper describes the interna-
tional Large Marine Ecosystem program, to which the US has been a 
major contributor.

The concepts of integrated ocean management and ecosystem-based 
management have been evolving in the US over the past forty years.  
The two concepts are closely intertwined.  Integrated ocean manage-
ment (IOM) may be defined as “a decision-making process that relies 
on diverse types of information to determine how ocean and coastal 
resources or areas are best used and protected” (NOS, 2007).  IOM is 
only useful if conducted within the context of identified ecosystems. 
Thus, IOM and the more recently developed concept of Ecosystem 
Based Approach to Ocean Management (EBOM) are inextricably 
linked.  EBOM is an integrated approach to management that consid-
ers the entire ecosystem, including humans (Box 1).

While we understand that the focus of the Arctic Council study is the 
Northern Ocean, the framework the US has designed for ocean man-
agement is comprehensive and flexible enough to apply to all ocean 
waters under US jurisdiction.  Therefore, this paper will describe the 
US experience in moving toward an integrated approach to ecosystem-
based ocean management by (1) explaining the enabling US federal 
oceans governance superstructure which facilitates ecosystem-based 
management; (2) discussing the National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration’s (NOAA’s) ecosystem approach to management; (3) 
linking this work to related and complementary regional collaboration 
initiatives and (4) international Large Marine Ecosystem activities.

The US is still working to implement its ecosystem approach to 
ocean management.  This paper lays out the mechanisms designed to 
promote the ecosystem approach and some of the elements already in 
place.  

I. Improving Ocean Governance
The US has established a system for overseeing the coordination of 
marine research and management activities.  This system anticipates 
future needs for the integration of complex ecosystem components, 
myriad data types, and diverse stakeholder interests into planning and 

Box 1:  Scientific Consensus Statement on Marine EBM
Ecosystem-based management is an integrated approach to 
management that considers the entire ecosystem, including  
humans. The goal of ecosystem-based management is to  
maintain an ecosystem in a healthy, productive and resilient 
condition so that it can provide the services humans want and 
need. Ecosystem-based management differs from current  
approaches that usually focus on a single species, sector, activity 
or concern; it considers the cumulative impacts of different  
sectors. Specifically, ecosystem-based management: 

•  emphasizes the protection of ecosystem structure, functioning,  
 and key processes; 

•  is place-based in focusing on a specific ecosystem and the range  
 of activities affecting it; 

•  explicitly accounts for the interconnectedness within systems,  
 recognizing the importance of interactions between many target  
 species or key services and other non-target species; 

•  acknowledges interconnectedness among systems, such as be 
 tween air, land and sea; and

•  integrates ecological, social, economic, and institutional   
 perspectives, recognizing their strong interdependences.

tional institutions, the private sector, NGOs, and local, tribal, state and 
regional governance.  The strategy emphasizes the importance of merit 
based- peer review; using existing implementation mechanisms, creat-
ing partnerships, balancing new developments with sustained efforts, 
and pursuing national priorities through scaled implementation.  By es-
tablishing a framework that coordinates all of these components within 
a focused research agenda that addresses clearly defined problems at 
appropriate scales, JSOST has made great progress toward one of the 
greatest challenges in the continued development of EBOM: the need 
for integrated science to support integrated management.  By including 
not just the scientific community, but stakeholders and governments 
as well, this plan ensures that relevant ecological, sociological, and 
economic information will feed into the ocean management process.  
Further, the approach detailed in this plan can be used as a template for 
a parallel plan for ocean management.

B. Ocean Management and SIMOR
The broad purpose of SIMOR is to “strengthen the effectiveness of 
interagency efforts at all levels while respecting existing authorities 
and jurisdictions” (SIMOR, 2005).  To that end, SIMOR has developed 
a Work Plan focused on four Work Priority Areas (Box 4).  The Work 
Plan, released in March, 2006, discusses challenges and discusses next 
steps for progress in each of the four Work Priority Areas.  

In each of these areas, the plan identifies gaps in integration and 
coordination of science and management, and between different layers 
of management.  While not as detailed or comprehensive as JSOST’s 
ocean science strategy, the SIMOR Work Plan does outline an imple-
mentation approach for EBOM.  

The new US ocean governance structure raises the profile of marine 
resource management, and is designed to allow for a more responsive 
and comprehensive treatment of large-scale problems related to the 
marine environment.  As the following section will show, ongoing 
Federal initiatives fit nicely into this framework, and will be better able 
contribute to EBOM once they are coordinated through SIMOR.      

II. NOAA’s Ecosystem Approach to Management/EBM
While many Federal initiatives incorporate ecosystem principles into 
management practices, the most important of these in the marine 
environment is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administra-
tion’s (NOAA) adoption and application of an Ecosystem Approach 
to Management for oceans and coasts.  In response to the 2004 U.S. 
Ocean Action Plan, NOAA has developed and pursued an ecosystem

approach to the management of marine resources under its jurisdic-
tion.  Using the principles of Ecosystem- Based Management (Box 1), 
NOAA’s Ecosystem Goal Team, has the responsibility of developing 
strategies that ultimately accomplish two objectives:

1 Healthy and productive coastal and marine ecosystems that benefit  
 society, and

2 A well informed public that acts as a steward of coastal and marine  
 ecosystems

In pursuing these outcomes, NOAA integrates the contributions of 
nine programs that have research and management responsibilities that 
affect ecosystems (Box 5).  

In addition, NOAA has defined the boundaries of eight ecosystems to 
serve as management units for different areas of coastal and ocean wa-
ters adjacent to the US or its territories (Box 6).  Note that the Alaska 
Ecosystem Complex includes four Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs): 
Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea, Bering Sea, and Gulf of Alaska.  

The NOAA regional ecosystems also serve as the units of analysis for 
Integrated Ecosystem Assessments (IEAs), which are NOAA’s primary 
means of implementing the ecosystem approach.  IEAs are spatially 
based, scalable assessments that have three major components: (1) 
monitoring, (2) analysis of status and trends in space and time, and (3) 
integration and forecasting.  IEAs are an appropriate vehicle to convey 
information about the structure and function of ecosystems and to 
evaluate the impacts of current and proposed stressors.  By collecting 
and analyzing biological, oceanographic, and socioeconomic data, 
analyzing it in the context of past management strategies and current 
human behaviors, and predicting future trends, NOAA is using the IEA 
process as a proactive tool to identify long term research needs and 
resource management priorities, and support the ecosystem approach.

It is extremely important to emphasize the nested nature of ecosys-
tems, and consequently, of ecosystem assessments and management 
programs.  Within a large regional ecosystem exist many systems that 
function on smaller scales, including watersheds, estuaries, wetlands, 
and reefs.  Analysis of these sub-systems is crucial to the assessment of 
larger coastal and marine areas.  Further, communication and coopera-
tion between local, regional, and national managers and stakeholders 
is absolutely necessary to ensure a comprehensive, integrated approach 

Box 6: NOOA Regional Ecosystems

to management.  Finally, sound management of nested ecosystems not 
only contributes to success in addressing problems at a larger scale, 
but also may provide a model for managing similar systems elsewhere. 
(See Box 7)
  

With its explicit link to the US ocean governance structure which will 
be described below, NOAA provides input that informs the ocean 
management process, while receiving feedback on how it can improve 
the support functions of the ecosystem approach.  This two-way infor-
mation exchange facilitates the integration of NOAA’s work with that 
of other Federal agencies, as well as lower levels of government and 
other aforementioned parties critical to IOM, while ensuring that ocean 
management efforts will be ecosystem-based.      

III. Regional Collaboration
Supplementing and complementing the ecosystem-based approach, 
the US has historically attempted to use regional bodies for ocean 
resource management.  Regional collaboration has been tried in vari-
ous contexts in the US, with mixed results.  Federally led multi-state 
watershed management initiatives like the Chesapeake Bay Program 
and the Gulf of Mexico Program have had limited success, largely 
because of the difficulty of addressing land use issues.  However, in 
the context of inshore coastal fisheries, regional fishery management 
councils comprised of representatives from states that share fish stocks 
have proven more effective.      

In addition, NOAA has created a framework for domestic regional 
collaboration with regions that correspond to large marine ecosystems 
(LMEs) (Box 8). The 10 LMEs of the United States are regions of 
the ocean starting in coastal areas and extending out to the seaward 
boundaries of continental shelves and major current systems. They 
take into account the biological and physical components of the 
marine environment as well as terrestrial features such as river basins 
and estuaries that drain into these ocean areas. Development of the 
framework for regional collaboration employed a set of explicit criteria 
(Box 9), including consideration of the relationships between NOAA 
and various stakeholders, and amongst the stakeholders themselves, to 
divide the US into eight regions to serve as the base units for fostering 
stronger collaboration with governments and stakeholders, and among 
its own programs (Box 10).  These regions correspond closely to the 
LME units mentioned above.  

The three priorities NOAA has identified for regional collaboration 
(hazard resilient coastal communities, integrated ecosystem assess-

ments, and integrated water resource services) all have the potential to 
be key components of EBOM.  Coordinating these regionally-based 
management projects with broader initiatives conducted at ecosystem 
scales links Federal managers with state and local authorities in activi-
ties that combine place-specific concerns and expertise with ecosystem 
level science and planning.

Another ongoing regional initiative is the development of regional 
ocean councils.  In 2005, the New England Governor’s Conference 
formed The Northeast Regional Ocean Council (NROC).  
The primary intent of NROC is to link together and cultivate regional 
ocean management and science institutions and programs for the 
Gulf of Maine, Long Island Sound, and southeastern New England.  
Recently NROC produced a draft 1-year work plan that proposes it 
will focus on ocean energy resource planning and management; ocean 
and coastal ecosystem health; maritime security; and coastal hazard 
response and resiliency. The work plan contains the following actions:

	Submit an appropriations request from the New England governors  
 to support the Gulf of Maine Council on the Marine Environment  
 and the proposed Northeastern Sounds Ecosystem Alliance;

	Create a regional entity for southeastern New England’s sounds  
 par allel in purpose and scope to the Gulf of Maine Council on the  
 Marine Environment;

	Convene a Northeast Regional Ocean Congress to establish   
 short-term regional ocean management priorities;

	Seek an additional resolution from the NEGC/ECP annual meeting  
 for the Oceans Working Committee to issue an annual ocean  
 management priorities statement; and, Create Action Plans around  
 the priority issue areas

Box 7: Nested Ecosystems and Management Strategies

The Channel Islands National Park and National Marine  
Sanctuary are located off the coast of California, within the  
California Current Large Marine Ecosystem.  Traditionally an  
important area for commercial fishing and recreation, over-harves-
ting of commercially important species such as abalone and spiny 
lobster led to severe degradation of the park ecosystem by the 
1990s, including the loss of over 80% of giant kelp forests (Davis, 
2005).  Through a process that brought together scientists, stake-
holders, and officials from various levels of government, a network 
of marine reserves was established based on ecosystem criteria.  It 
is hoped that this network will allow the ecosystem to recover while 
having a minimal negative short-term socioeconomic impact. 

Box 8: US LMEs
LMEs correspond to natural features. The 10 Large Marine Ecosystems 
of the United States are regions of the ocean starting in coastal areas 
and extending out to the seaward boundaries of continental shelves and 
major current systems. They take into account the biological and physical 
components of the marine environment as well as terrestrial features such 
as river basins and estuaries that drain into these ocean areas.

The US has made support of NROC a priority, and has assigned work 
group leads from the Federal agencies responsible for both living and 
non-living coastal and marine resources.  The New England Gover-
nor’s Conference has also reached out to the Eastern Canadian Pre-
miers, and the two groups have signed a resolution pledging coopera-
tion on ocean governance issues under the framework of the NROC.  

Other similar programs on the regional scale include the Gulf of 
Mexico Regional Partnership (GMRP), and the Great Lakes Regional 
Collaboration (GLRC), which were commissioned by the US Ocean 
Action Plan, and link Federal agencies and state governors with their 
counterparts in Mexico and Canada respectively.  Building upon the 
work already being conducted by the Gulf of Mexico Alliance, the 
GMRP draws on Federal government resources to improve coordina-
tion between states, and with the six Mexican states that border the 
Gulf through the Accord of the States of the Gulf of Mexico.  Also a 
priority in the SIMOR work plan, GMRP convened a working group 
comprised of representatives from 13 Federal agencies and numerous 
state officials in 2005, which resulted in the release of the Governors’ 
Action Plan for Healthy and Resilient Coasts the following year.  This 
document identifies the following key areas of regional cooperation:

Water quality for healthy beaches and shellfish beds;
• Wetland and coastal conservation and restoration;
•  Environmental education;
•  Identification and characterization of Gulf habitats, and
•  Reductions in nutrient inputs to coastal ecosystems.

Pursuit of these objectives, coupled with increased collaboration 
with international partners, will improve the management of natural 
resources, coastal communities, and environmentally sensitive areas in 
and around the Gulf of Mexico.

The GRLC is a wide-ranging, cooperative effort to design and imple-
ment a strategy for the restoration, protection and sustainable use of 
the Great Lakes.  Through GRLC, states have teamed with the US 
Environmental Protection Agency and NOAA to develop a Strategy to 
Restore and Protect the Great Lakes, which addresses such regional 
concerns as invasive species, non-point 
source pollution, coastal zone manage-
ment, habitat-species linkages, sedimenta-
tion, toxics, sustainable development, data/
information integration, and environmental 
indicator identification/development.  By 
involving managers representing the 
entirety of the Great Lakes complex, 
including Canadian partners, the GRLC 
enables a treatment of these issues that is 

comprehensive, rather than piecemeal.       
The three projects described above not only ad-
dress the challenge of coordinating across jurisdic-
tional boundaries within the US, but also take the 
first steps toward accomplishing the larger goal 
of achieving regional cooperation across national 
boundaries.  Harmonizing management of the 
marine environment amongst countries that share 
a common ecosystem or resource pool will lead 
to more effective policies governing the balance 
between exploitation and protection.  This type 
of cooperation is critical, especially given the im-
portance to ecosystems of migratory species and 
large-scale processes like ocean currents, circula-
tion patterns, and climate interactions.  By starting 
with our neighbors to the North and South, and 
engaging stakeholders as well as governments, the 
US seeks to create a model that it can extend to 
other regional partners in the future.  

IV. International Approaches
A. Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs)
The U.S. Administration’s Ocean Action Plan 
(OAP) indicates that the “U.S. will promote, with-

in the United Nations Environment Program’s regional seas programs 
and by international fisheries bodies, the use of the Large Marine 
Ecosystems (LME) concept as a tool for enabling ecosystem-based 
management to provide a collaborative approach to management of 
resources within ecologically bounded transnational areas. This will 
be done in an international context and consistent with customary 
international law as reflected in 1982 UN Convention on the Law of 
the Sea.” (U.S. Ocean Action Plan, 2004).  NOAA is the lead agency 
in these efforts.

Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs) are regions of ocean space of about 
200,000 km2 or greater that encompass coastal areas from river basins 
and estuaries out seaward to the break or slope of the continental 
shelf, or out to the seaward extent of a well-defined principal current. 
LMEs are defined not by political, but by ecological criteria, including 
bathymetry, hydrography, marine productivity, and trophically linked 
populations. Since 1984, the LME Program has developed ecosystem 
management tools, initiated projects that have been funded by partner 
organizations, and provided training for developing country partici-
pants, helping to raise their level of expertise, their scientific under-
standing and their capabilities to conduct resource and environmental 
assessments and improve resource management practices. The LME 
concept for ecosystem-based management and its 5-module approach 
(productivity, fish and fisheries, pollution and ecosystem health, 
socioeconomics, and governance) are being applied globally to analyze 
ecosystem-wide changes, and provide the scientific foundation for 
management actions that link scientific assessments, protection of the 
marine environment, sustainable development of coastal and marine 
resources, and poverty alleviation. 

The NOAA LME Program is now partnering with the Global Envi-
ronment Facility (GEF)/World Bank, five U.N. agencies (UNIDO, 
UNDP, FAO, IOC-UNESCO and UNEP), and two NGOs (IUCN and 
WWF) to promote the use of the LME approach to the assessment and 
management of marine resources in Africa, Asia, Latin America and 
eastern Europe.  A total of 110 countries and an estimated network of 
2,500 scientists, marine specialists and resource managers and partners 
are participating in 16 international LME Projects (Box 11), funded 
with grants and investment funds totaling $1.8 billion. The operational

strategies for the 4th replenishment of the GEF (2007-2010) will further 
augment international LME activities by $230 million. Supplemental 
financing of LME “Foundation” projects by the World Bank and re-
gional development banks in the form of low-interest investment loans 
and no-interest revolving funds, is likely to increase support of LME 
projects to a level of $3 billion by 2010. 

In the 16 GEF-supported LME projects, the 5-modular assessments are 
identifying ecosystem trends necessitating a precautionary approach to 
fisheries, improved forecasting of fishery fluctuations, conservation of 
biodiversity and, the reduction of excessive nitrogen loading and as-
sessment of and adaptation to climate change.  The projects use LMEs 
as the geographic focus for strategies to reduce coastal pollution, re-
store damaged habitats, and recover depleted fisheries. This effort will 
continue in partnership with the UN and other agencies through 2010. 

In 2004, the NOAA LME Program partnered with the UNEP-Regional 
Seas Programme, when the 6th global meeting of the UNEP Regional 
Seas Conventions adopted a resolution to incorporate the LME 5-mod-
ule approach to assessment and management of marine resources, and 
use LMEs as operational/management units for translating Regional 
Seas programs into concrete actions. In 2005, The LME Program part-
nered with the UNEP Global Progamme of Action for the Protection of 
the Marine Environment from Land-based Sources of Pollution (GPA), 
to assist developing nations in restoring and sustaining the goods and 
services of the world’s LMEs, and to support an integrated approach 
to oceans management and a reduction of land based pollution. As 
an outcome of the second session of the Intergovernmental Review 
Meeting on the Implementation of the GPA in October 2006, the 
Beijing Declaration furthered the mainstreaming of the LME concept 
by outlining national, regional, and international actions needed to 
apply ecosystem approaches, value the social and economics costs and 
benefits of the goods and services that oceans and coasts can provide, 
and address coastal pollution by reducing and controlling nutrient over 
enrichment in LME coastal waters. 

B. Arctic LME Activities
The Arctic LMEs are diverse and dynamic systems under stress from 
global warming and the melting of sea ice. Marine species are few, 
but each species has high numbers.  Advances in the melting of Arctic 
ice have implications for zooplankton, fisheries, fish stocks, marine 
mammals, marine birds, which appear to be shifting northward, and 
socioeconomic conditions for Arctic people.

One of the major priorities of the Arctic Council Working Group on 
Protection of the Arctic Marine Environment (PAME) for 2006-2008 is 
the introduction of the LME approach to the assessment and manage-
ment of Arctic ecosystems. The United States has been the lead on 
the ecosystem approach and has updated PAME on the status of the 
LME approach to assessment and management, in which place-based 
assessments of the changing states of Arctic LMEs can serve as the 
framework for ecosystem-based management practices. Planning for 
the introduction of the ecosystem-based approach was initiated with 
the LME Working Group and its representatives from the 8 participat-
ing countries. At this date, the countries have reviewed and accepted a 
working map of 17 Arctic LMEs that will be used to guide the PAME 
work plan. The PAME LME Working group has organized an e-mail 
exchange between key experts from each of the Arctic Council coun-
tries to consider suites of indicators of changing states of Arctic LMEs, 
as measured against baselines of (i) productivity/climate, (ii) fish and 
fisheries/marine birds and mammals, (iii) pollution and ecosystem 
health, (iv) socioeconomics, and (v) governance. This effort to reach 
consensus on generic suites of indicators for assessing the changing 
states of 17 Arctic LMEs will effectively guide decision-making in the 
Arctic Region. The LME Experts Group will work in close coopera-
tion with other experts associated with the activities of other Arctic 
Council Working Groups including AMAP, CAFF and SDWG.

NOAA’s Alaska Fisheries Science Center, the North Pacific Fishery 
Management Council (NPFMC), and the academic community have 
been paying a great deal of attention of ecosystem assessments and 
approaches to management.  While research is ongoing, the NPFMC 
has adopted an ecosystem-based approach to the management of the 
EBS LME groundfish fishery through a 1.4-2.0 million metric ton 

Optimum Yield  approach since 1982 that has maintained the health of 
the fisheries resources and stabilized the fisheries catch.  The NPFMC 
has implemented a large scale closure of marine areas along the 
Aleutians to protect cold coral and essential fish habitats.  The council 
is now working on developing an ecosystem management plan for the 
Aleutian Island sub-area of the EBS LME.  

The NPFMC is also presently developing options for fishery manage-
ment in the Arctic, north of Bering Strait.  It has determined that a 
more deliberate and comprehensive management regime should be put 
in place for the Arctic region. This is partly in anticipation of potential 
fishery development in the region as climate conditions continue to 
warm. But this is also in response to some of the unique ecological 
conditions in the Arctic region, and the unique nature of the region’s 
coastal communities, that merit more attention than has been given 
to this area previously. The NPFMC views the development of an 
Arctic Marine Resources FMP as an opportunity for implementing an 
ecosystem-based management policy that recognizes the unique issues 
in the Alaskan Arctic.  

PAME has also discussed the opportunity to develop the LME ap-
proach for pilot assessment and management projects for the Arctic, in 
the West Bering Sea, the Barents Sea, and the Beaufort Sea. The West 
Bering Sea (WBS) LME supports fish, crustaceans, mollusks, marine 
birds and marine mammals. The catch of fish including pollock has 
undergone periods of growth and decline since 1975 for the fish in the 
Navarin sub-area of the WBSLME.  

The Barents Sea LME, shared by the Russian Federation and Norway, 
is shallow, with a large shelf and an extensive polar front. It is a transi-
tion zone where relatively warm inflowing Atlantic water is cooled 
and transformed into Arctic as well as Polar water. The climate of this 
LME shows high spatial and temporal variability that depends mainly 
on the activity and temperature of the inflowing Atlantic water. There 
is considerable annual and inter-annual variations in ice cover, which 
extends over one- to two-thirds of the LME with maximum extension 
during winter. The Barents Sea LME is considered a moderately high 
productivity ecosystem, with biological activity determined mainly 
by seasonal changes in the temperature and light regimes, advection 
and ice cover. The major species fished are capelin, Atlantic cod and 
herring, with capelin and herring being major prey of cod. During the 
last decades, biomass yields of the major species have fluctuated sig-
nificantly because of high fishing mortality and variation in the natural 
environment.

In addition, Canada is prepared to collaborate with the U.S. on a 
LME demonstration project in the Beaufort Sea LME (BSLME).  The 
BSLME is a high-latitude, mostly ice-covered LME bordered by 
northern Alaska and Canada, with an Arctic climate and extreme envi-
ronment driven by major seasonal and annual changes.  New develop-
ments for the production of gas and oil are contemplated.  It is clear 
from existing assessments that the resident populations on both the 
Canadian and U.S. coasts of the BSLME are undergoing major socio-
economic changes, caused by the significant increase in the rate of ice 
melt in the ecosystem.  While the LME is considered a low productiv-
ity ecosystem, with high productivity only in the summer when the ice 
melts, an important question is how this productivity might change un-
der an altered climatic regime.  The effects of changing conditions in 
the BSLME need to be better understood and taken into consideration 
as the basis for adaptation actions for sustaining the living resources 
and biodiversity of the ecosystem, under a policy that can demonstrate 
utility in balancing economic development with an appropriate level of 
sustainability in the goods and services produced by the ecosystem.

V. Conclusion
It is fair to characterize the United States as “on the road” to imple-
mentation of ecosystem based ocean management.  The U.S. Ocean 
Action Plan established the high level policy infrastructure necessary 
to achieve this goal.  Decisions by this infrastructure and products pre-
pared by its operating elements have moved the United States toward 
the ecosystem approach.

A major U.S. oceans science and management agency, NOAA, has 
adopted Ecosystem Based Management as one of its strategic goals.  It

has elaborated its notion of EBM and created the organization mecha-
nisms need to consider and create implementation programs.

Further, the U.S, with various partners, is pursuing a range of collabo-
rative activities at the regional level.  These activities involve interna-
tional partners and cooperation among different levels of government.  
They include robust involvement of stakeholders.

Finally, pursuant to the decision reflected in the Ocean Action Plan, 
the U.S. has been a leader in implementing large marine ecosystem 
programs throughout the world.

While the U.S. has made major strides in developing major compo-
nents of a strategy for ecosystem based ocean management, additional 
work is required before all these pieces come together.  It would ap-
pear that the will and direction exist to achieve this goal in the coming 
years.

Annex A:
The Alaska Ecosystems
There are four LMEs off Alaska within the US EEZ that should be of 
interest to the Arctic Council – the Gulf of Alaska (GOA) LME, the 
East Bering Sea (EBS) LME , the Chukchi Sea (CS) LME and the 
Beaufort Sea (BS) LME.  The EBS LME includes the Aleutian Islands 
Sub-Area and is the most productive LME in the US in terms of fisher-
ies, followed by the GOA LME.  Together, these two systems have 
produced 55% of US fisheries landings in recent years.  The CS and 
BS LMEs, while not supporting large fisheries, are undergoing rapid 
changes as annual and multiyear ice coverage shrinks relative to the 
past 50 years.  
 
These LMEs have experienced different climatic regimes and shifts in 
modern times.  A report by King (2005) indicates that the environment 
of the North Pacific marine ecosystems has shifted; apparently a few 
times.  It follows that the features of the living marine resources of the 
Alaskan LMEs have also changed over time.  King (2005) cites several 
examples of decadal-scale changes in biological production and com-
munity composition that occurred around 1977 and in the 1990s. The 
scientific literature now generally recognizes that recent regime shifts 
occurred in 1925, 1947, 1977 and 1989.  Hare and Mantua (2000) 
assembled and examined 100 environmental time series (31 climatic 
and 69 biological) for evidence of biological and physical responses 
to these regime shift signals.  Levitus et al. (2000) reported that the 
Pacific Ocean has undergone a net warming since the 1950s.  Changes 
in ocean temperature on a shorter time basis can be quite variable, and 
often mask long-term trends in ocean warming.  Determining how 
these higher temperature variations will affect living marine resources 
(LMRs) on a short-term basis, and how they might mask the longer 
term effects of a gradual warming of the oceans are key management 
questions that require an ecosystem approach.
To support management of the ecosystems off Alaska, NOAA conducts 
research and collecting data that will eventually merge into better com-
prehensive assessments and management of the LMEs. This research 
includes oceanography and othe aspects of the physical environment, 
as well as the dynamics of LMRs.  The LMRs of special and unique 
concern in the Alaska LMEs are the marine mammals, seabirds, and 
fishery resources.  They all occur in high abundance and/or in high 
profile in a changing dynamaic environment.   
On marine mammal research, the The US has been conducting peri-
odic stock assessment surveys for pinnipeds and cetaceans in the EBS, 
BS, and CS LMEs. The results of these assessments provide details 
on population sizes and trends, stock identification, and potential 
anthropogenic impacts such as interactions with commercial fisheries, 
oil and gas development, and subsistence harvests.  In addition to these 
studies, the US conducts a broad range of research on marine mammal 
ecology and behavior.  In light of the potential effects of the loss of 
sea ice and climate change, this research is increasingly focused on 
better understanding the habitat requirements of the different marine 
mammal species. US government agencies also interact with domestic 
and international entities on issues pertaining to marine mammals in 
these LMEs.  For example, the US-Russia Marine Mammal Working 
Group, under Area V of the US-Russia Agreement on Cooperation in 
the Field of Environmental Protection, convenes bi-annually to present 

recent research results and discuss issues of marine mammal science 
and conservation in the Bering and Chukchi Seas.  Similarly, the US 
government has co-management agreements with several Alaska Na-
tive groups concerning the subsistence use of marine mammals.  
For fisheries, research has been extensive on salmon, all the major 
groundfish resources, king and tanner crabs, shrimps, and all the 
ecologically related species, including lower trophic levels, down 
to phytoplankton blooms. Trawl surveys on the groundfish and crab 
resources in the shelf area of the EBS LME have been conducted an-
nually since about 1972 and regular two-year phase surveys have taken 
place in the Aleutians and Gulf of Alaska regions.  Longline surveys 
on Pacific Halibut have been conducetd by the International Pacific 
Halibut Commission that started back in the early 1900s. Longline 
surveys on sablefish (blackcod) have also been annual for more than 
15 years. 
 
The scientists of various NOAA agencies have also collaborated on 
FOCI-type studies (Fishery-Oceanography Coordinated Investigations) 
to study how ocean dynamics affect components of the ecosystems and 
determine survival of the LMRs.  The also conduct special cruises to 
study marine mammal-fisheries-and seabird interactions.  NOAA Fish-
eries also has an extensive observer program where trained biologists 
are placed onboard fishing vessels, processing vessels, and on-shore 
processing plats to collect data scientifically for the sciences.  The 
extent of observer coverage is 100% for the large vessels and process-
ing plants.  At worst, the smaller operators are covered 30% of their 
operational time.

All the data that are being collected from marine mammals, fish, crabs, 
other LMRS and those FOCI-data collected by other US Govern-
ment Agencies (Fish and Wildlife Service, Environmental Protection 
Agency, etc.); State agencies (like the Alaska Department of Fish and 
Game); academic institutions (like the University of Washington and 
University of Alaska) and special research-funding agencies (like the 
North Pacific Research Board and the SeaLife Center) are being exam-
ined for their broader applications  and integration into in ecosystem 
assessments and management. 

As the ocean environment is undergoing rapid changes, the North 
Pacific Research Board has encouraged use of integrated science to 
ecosystem approaches of research and funding research projects in 
consultation with Federal and State agencies, Universities, and the 
National Science Foundation.  A Bering Sea Integrated Research Plan 
has been developed and funded.  A similar exercise to develop a Gulf 
of Alaska Integrated Research Plan is under way.  Some of the more 
innovative research plans that are coming online in the near future are 
“Loss of Sea Ice” and “Ocean Acidification”.  All the research projects 
are geared towards ecosystem approaches to assessments and manage-
ment.

North Pacific Fishery Management Council
The North Pacific Fishery Management Council (Council)1 recognizes emerging concerns over climate warming and receding seasonal ice 
cover in Alaska’s Arctic region, and the potential long term effects from these changes on the Arctic marine ecosystem.  The Council has 
expressed concern over potential effects of these ecosystem changes on fish populations in the Arctic region, and has developed a strategy to 
prepare for possible future change in the Arctic region.  The Council has determined that a fishery management regime for Alaska’s Arctic 
marine waters is necessary.

 The Council proposes to develop an Arctic Fishery Management Plan (FMP) that would (1) close the Arctic to commercial fishing until 
information improves so that fishing can be conducted sustainably and with due concern to other ecosystem components; (2) determine the 
fishery management authorities in the Arctic and provide the Council with a vehicle for addressing future management issues; and (3) imple-
ment its ecosystem based management policy that recognizes the unique issues in the Alaskan Arctic.  This precautionary action is necessary 
to prevent commercial fisheries from developing in the Arctic without the required management framework and scientific information on the 
fish stocks, their characteristics, and the implications of fishing for the stocks and related components of the ecosystem.
The Arctic Management Area is all marine waters in the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of the Chukchi and Beaufort Seas from 3 nautical 
miles offshore the coast of Alaska or its baseline to 200 nautical miles offshore, north of Bering Strait (from Cape Prince of Wales to Cape 
Dezhneva) and westward to the U.S./Russia Convention Line of 1867 and eastward to the U.S. Canada maritime boundary.

1   The fishery management council system was established by Congress in 1976 for the purpose of managing fisheries in a newly recognized exclusive economic zone (EEZ) between  
 3 and 200 miles offshore of the United States of America coastline. The eight regional fishery management councils are decision-making bodies and develop and recommend specific  
 management measures in the form of fishery management plans, subject to approval and implementation by NOAA Fisheries.

Introduction
With population growth and technological advances, the demand for 
the ecological services of the oceans is growing. This has brought 
increasing pressure on natural resources and the marine environment. 
Living marine resources are in many instances overexploited. Pollution 
pressures are high in some regions. And various uses of the oceans 
may be difficult to reconcile. At the same time, climate change consti-
tute and important driver for change in the marine environment.1 

The changing nature of oceans can be witnessed also in the Arctic. Al-
though Arctic marine ecosystems in general are healthy, the increasing 
pressures on them raise shared concerns and opportunities for Arctic 
countries. The Arctic countries have in the 2004 Arctic Marine Strate-
gic Plan pointed to the ecosystem-based approach to oceans manage-
ment as a critical measure in confronting these challenges.

Numerous international agreements commit states to the introduc-
tion of ecosystems-based oceans management. In particular, the 2001 
World Summit on Sustainable Development in its Johannesburg Joint 
Plan of Action specified that:

“Oceans, seas, islands and coastal areas form an integrated and 
essential component of the Earth’s ecosystem and are critical for 
global food security and for sustaining economic prosperity and the 
well-being of many national economies … (and) … Encourage the ap-
plication by 2010 of the ecosystem approach…” (para 30, JPOI).

This has since been followed up upon by many countries, in develop-
ing and implementing plans for integrated oceans management, includ-
ing ecosystems-based management. All Arctic countries have or have 
undertaken important work in this regard, and several of them have 
implemented or are in the process of implementing ecosystems-based 
oceans management in one form or another. 

Ecosystems-based oceans management fundamentally comes in two 
forms: either as an overarching plan including all aspects of ocean use, 
or more narrowly defined, sector based approaches to ecosystems-
based oceans management, pertaining to for example fisheries. These 
approaches are not mutually exclusive, and in some countries they 
coexist at various levels of governance. Both approaches are found in 
the Arctic.

The project
The objective of the Best Practices in Ecosystem-based Oceans 
Management in the Arctic (BePOMAr) Project is to present the 
concepts and practices the Arctic countries have developed for the ap-
plication of an ecosystem-based approach to oceans management. By 
reviewing how countries actually put such concepts and practices to 
use, lessons can be drawn on how to effectively do ecosystems-based 
oceans management. 

Two sets of questions address the substance and process of putting 
ecosystems-based oceans management to work, respectively:

•  Which practices and approaches have proved useful in moving  
 towards effective protection and sustainable use of the Arctic  
 marine environment?

•  What are the main obstacles, and what are the important success  
 elements in moving towards ecosystems-based oceans   
 management?

The elements to be considered include how countries define eco-
systems-based oceans management, the types of objectives that are 
formulated, the choice of policy instruments and organization of the 
work, for example in terms of how stakeholders are consulted and 
the geographical context for ecosystems-based oceans management, 
including existing transboundary agreements relevant to the manage-
ment of Arctic marine ecosystems. 

An important aspect of the practices considered is that they address 
use as well as conservation and protection of marine ecosystems. The 
sustainable use of the natural resources in the marine environment is a 
major issue in this regard.

The question of obstacles and success elements has been considered 
by asking the Arctic countries to describe their experiences in applying 
an ecosystems-based approach to oceans management. Important ele-
ments here include the process aspects of interagency cooperation and 
the organization of that, the organization and use of science, and stake-
holder involvement, as well as the actual content of ecosystems-based 
oceans management, such as institutions for ecosystems-based oceans 
management, legislation and policy tools, geographical approaches, 
including LMEs, and biodiversity considerations.

The project is built around 7 case studies of how countries develop 
and implement ecosystems-based oceans management in the Arctic: 
Russia, Finland, Norway, Iceland, Greenland, Canada and the USA. 
An additional case study presents an indigenous perspective on these 
issues.

These case studies represent a very diverse set of practices for 
ecosystems-based oceans management. For one thing, they vary in 
geographical scope. The countries also are very diverse with respect 
to administrative traditions and cultures. Also, the types of ecosys-
tems included in this study range from boreal in the Atlantic to Arctic. 
Moreover, the challenges countries face with regard to ecosystems-
based oceans management vary considerably, with some primarily 
being concerned with fisheries, while other consider how to reconcile 
the concerns of fisheries, petroleum and the protection of the marine 
environment. 

All Arctic countries face the reality of their marine ecosystems being 
to some extent shared with other countries (map). The application of 
ecosystem-based approaches to oceans management may therefore 
raise transboundary issues. A large number of bilateral and regional 
agreements address such transboundary issues, mostly on a sectoral 
basis as the case is in relation to fisheries. In relation to the central 
Arctic Ocean, there is only one international agreement specific to that 
region, the 1973 International Polar Bear Treaty.2

The fundamental principles and rules for the management of Arctic 
marine ecosystems are set forth in the Law of the Sea Convention, 
including provisions regarding the high seas beyond national jurisdic-
tion. 

The case studies in perspective
 

There are numerous definitions of the Arctic. The Arctic ocean proper, 
to the North of the continents, is about 14 million km2. Little eco-
nomic activity take place here. The bulk of the commercial economic 
activity in the Arctic region takes place in the bordering seas, like the 
Bering and the Barents Sea, i the waters around Iceland and Green-
land, and in the Baltic.

Some ecosystems straddle the jurisdiction of several countries. This 
give rise to a number of transboundary issues relating to for example 
fisheries and pollution. The states in the Arctic region have established 
a number of bilateral and multilateral cooperative agreements in 
response to such transboundary problems. 

Observed Best Practices in Ecosystem-based 
Oceans Management in the Arctic Countries

Background and objective
The need for oceans management based on an ecosystem approach 
is widely recognized by the international community, as reflected in 
calls for the implementation of the ecosystem approach by 2010 in the 
2002 Johannesburg Plan of Implementation from the World Summit on 
Sustainable Development (WSSD), in recommendations from the UN 
General Assembly, in the work under the Convention on Biological 
Diversity, and in the 2001 Reykjavik Declaration on Responsible Fish-
eries in the Marine Ecosystem. These international commitments have 
proved particularly important in the Arctic region, where this project 
represents a collective attempt at demonstrating progress towards the 
WSSD goals in the region.

Many Arctic communities and settlements are based on the sustain-
able use of natural resources, and see themselves as integrated parts of 
these ecosystems. The importance of the non-renewable resources is 
growing, and offshore petroleum developments are expanding to new 
areas of the Arctic. Likewise, tourism is growing in importance, and 
with it cruiseship traffic. Other economic developments include expan-
sion of mining, bioprospecting, aquaculture, and marine transporta-
tion. At the same time, climate change, increased pollution and other 
human-induced pressures brings unprecedented rates of change in 
marine ecosystems. 

The aggregate effects of these multiple pressures on the oceans call 
for an ecosystem-based and integrated approach to oceans manage-
ment. This is critical to the protection and sustainable use of marine 
ecosystems and the natural resources there. To aid in this process, the 
Arctic Marine Strategic Plan, which describes the ecosystem approach 
and calls for its application, was adopted by the Arctic Council in 
November 2004. Ecosystem-based management is the key principle of 
the Arctic Marine Strategic Plan.

Many countries are now in the process of reviewing and developing 
their oceans management policies in order to base their management 
and use of the oceans on ecosystem considerations.  In the Arctic, for 
instance, most countries are working to implement ecosystem-based 
management of their oceans.

The Best Practices in Ecosystem-based Oceans Management project, 
carried out by the Arctic Council working groups on Sustainable 
Development and Protection of the Arctic Marine Environment, has 
observed a number of Best Practices in this regard, which governments 
may want to consider. These practices have proved useful and may be 
relevant also to other Arctic countries as well as in the world beyond, 
in order to provide for sustainable development and protection of the 
marine environment.

Core elements
 

Although definitions may differ, some core elements are essential to 
ecosystems based oceans management:

•  The geographical scope of ecosystems defined by ecological  
 criteria.
•  The development of scientific understanding of systems and of the  
 relationship between human actions and changes in other system  
 components.
•  The application of the best available scientific and other knowledge  
 to understand ecosystem interactions and manage human activities  
 accordingly.
•  An integrated and multidisciplinary approach to management that 
 takes into account the entire ecosystem, including humans. 
•  Area-based management and use of scientific and other information  
 on ecosystem changes to continually adapt management of human  
 activities. 
•  The assessment of cumulative impacts of different sectors on the  
 eco-system, instead of single species, sectoral approaches. 
•  A comprehensive framework with explicit conservation standards,  
 targets and indicators in order to facilitate responses to changes in  
 the eco-system 
•  Transboundary arrangements for resolution and handling of   
 transboundary ecosystems and issues.

Conclusions
In reviewing the practices countries have established in developing 
and implementing ecosystem-based oceans management, the follow-
ing have been found useful: 1) flexible application, 2) integrated and  
science based decision-making, 3) commitment to ecosystem-based 
oceans management, 4) area-based approaches and transboundary per-
spectives  5) stakeholder participation , and 6) adaptive management. 

1) Flexible application of effective ecosystem-based oceans  
management
Differences in circumstances and contexts have to be taken into con-
sideration as  ecosystem-based oceans management is context sensi-
tive. There is not one single method for ecosystem-based management. 

A number of different practices and understandings of the concept 
appear to work.

Ecosystem-based management is a work in progress and should be 
considered a process rather than an end state.

Rule-based relationships between countries in oceans affairs, based on 
applicable international law and agreements, have to be promoted.
Recognition of humans as an ecosystem component, and increased 
consideration of social effects when food security and poverty allevia-
tion are issues of concern.

Management must be based on best available science.  Open lines of 
communication between managers, resource users, and the general 
public are necessary to foster mutual understanding and recognition of 
shared interests.

Biodiversity conservation strengthens the structure and functions 
of ecosystems, thus ensuring the long term delivery of ecosystem 
services.

2) Decision-making must be integrated and science based 
Increased communication and exchanges among both states and sec-
tors are also key components of successful ecosystem-based manage-
ment. A great deal of scientific knowledge already exists. However, 
much of this information needs to be better synthesized and communi-
cated to a variety of audiences. Cooperation in science and exchange 
of relevant information within and between countries is important 
for understanding the cumulative impacts to the marine environment.  
Another challenge is to address what information exists and what 
information still needs to be gathered. Knowledge gaps can be closed 
through development/identification of key ecosystem indicators and 
comprehensive modelling, mapping, monitoring, and analysis.
Various forms of scientific, traditional, and management knowledge 
need to be integrated to improve ecosystem-based management. Po-
tential advantages of integrating various forms of knowledge include 
decision-making that is better informed, more flexible, and incorpo-
rates traditional ecological knowledge.

A multi-sector approach lies at the core of the ecosystem approach 
as it contributes to a common understanding of challenges in oceans 
management and thereby an increased trust between authorities with 
different sector responsibilities/interests. Ecosystem-based  manage-
ment calls for coordination and shared responsibility between all 
levels of government and cooperation across sectors, both with respect 
to monitoring, mapping and research. The challenge of monitoring, 
however, is both a scientific challenge and a policy issue. Monitoring 
programs can provide the ongoing basis for management, but require a 
long-term commitment of resources. Secondly, a multi-sector approach 
depends on providing opportunity for stakeholder comments on how 
a specific sector is to be managed or how to assess the impact of that 
sector in relation to the ecosystem. This is a difficult process, requiring 
care and time. 

3) National commitment is required for effective management
National commitment to conservation and sustainable use of ocean 
resources is necessary. A “roadmap”, management plan or national ac-
tion plan for addressing priorities in oceans management is developed 
in many of the Artic countries.

An integrated organizational structure (framework) to support the co-
ordination of a holistic approach to the implementation of EBM at the 
national level through inter-agency cooperation seems to be effective. 
In this respect, harmonization of domestic laws governing use of ocean 
resources with EBM principles, as well as with regional and interna-
tional management efforts may be appropriate. This requires legisla-
tion and enforceable policy tools to provide government strategic 
directions and overall framework for ecosystem-based management 
implementation.

4) Area-based approaches and transboundary perspectives are 
necessary
Area-based management approaches are central to ecosystem-based 
management. The identification of management units within  
ecosystems should be based on ecological criteria. Management

measures should reflect the status of areas and take into account the 
human element. 

Ecosystem-based management requires specific geographical units at 
various scales. 

Issues of scale can be addressed viewing ecosystems as nested 
systems.

The identification and protection (including through protected areas 
and networks) of key areas, species, and features that play a significant 
role within the marine ecosystem help management set priorities and 
ensure ecosystem structure and function are maintained.

Increased international cooperation in shared ecosystems could be  
addressed through existing regional management bodies and, as  
necessary, new collaborative efforts focused on individual ecosystems.
Effective area-based approaches include mechanisms for addressing 
effects of land-based activities and atmospheric deposition on ocean 
ecosystems.

5) Stakeholder and Arctic resident participation is a key element
Stakeholder and Arctic resident consultation are important to build 
understanding and foster development of knowledge. 

Stakeholder participation can be encouraged by providing for public 
participation in a manner that enables stakeholders and members of the 
public who lack the capacity to prepare for/attend numerous meetings 
to make their voices heard in a meaningful fashion. 

Stakeholders can be engaged to develop and strengthen cooperative 
processes to sustain ecosystem structure and function.

Effective stakeholder participation can encourage and achieve 
compliance with necessary conservation measures through education 
and enforcement.

6) Adaptive management is critical
Effective management requires adaptive management strategies that 
reflect changing circumstances. This is especially important in view of 
the accellerating effects of climate change on marine ecosystems.   
Implementation of ecosystem-based management should be 
approached incrementally. 

Conservation objctives and targets, benchmarks and action tresholds 
should be set for the measurement of achievement of ecosystem health. 
Flexible mechanisms should be used for implementing ecosystem-
based management.
