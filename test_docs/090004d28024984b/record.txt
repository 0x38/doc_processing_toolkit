Hi Candace,

We appreciated the opportunity to meet with you and the team in
Kotzebue last week, I hope the rest of your trip went well.  I have a
question on the alternatives that I failed to clarify last week.
Alternative 2 with the level 1 activity is the option that we like for
its smaller scale activity it allows, however we also like additional
required time/area closures element included in Alternative 4.
However Alternative 4 is tied to the Level 2 activity and not the
lesser Level 1 which we prefer.  So my question is whether it is only
practically applicable to level 2 activity since level 1 activity
would make the additional measures unnecessary because the allowable
activity would not impact those areas by default?   Or is it a quid
pro quo for allowing Level 2 activity by having more restrictions in
place on all exploration.  If Level 1 activity is applicable to
impacting the areas set aside under the additional required time/area
closers then it would seem useful from our perspective to support
level 1 activity with these additional required time/area closures?  A
mix and match approach.  Please clarify if you can.

Thank you,
