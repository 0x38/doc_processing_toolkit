Thanks for the quick response.  We are going to support a level 1 with required closures from alternative 4.  
 
Surprisingly there is another area we did not discuss in enough detail and that is regarding the Hope Basin, while it is
included in the EIS area, the discussion (and exclusion/timing areas) mainly focuses on the general area of 193 sales.
 However if it is likey that seismic activity will occur in the Hope basin (which is included in the EIS area afterall) then
our comments would be tailored to add exclusion areas in and adjacent to Kotzebue Sound.  Northern Kotzebue
Sound is extremley important to our members for seal and beluga hunting, as such exploration activity would have
great potential to impact this if not done with proper timing and geographical restrictions.  I forgot to give you a copy of
our recent book "Combining IÃ±upiaq and Scientific Knowledge: Ecology in Northern Kotzebue Sound, Alaska",
discussing this area, which by the way should be referenced in the final EIS bibly - it can be found at:
 
 http://seagrant.uaf.edu/bookstore/pubs/SG-ED-72.html
 
It would be nice if you could order a copy or two to support the effort, but I would be willing to send either on of you, or
the reviewers in NOAA a copy or two for developing the final EIS if needed, just let me know.
 
I imagine Kivalina and Point Hope would want exclusion areas also.  It is easy to forget or not notice the inclusion of
the Hope Basin including the nearshore areas, sincen again the majority of the discussion is focused up north and of
course that is where all the money is invested and Hope Basin has not proven the same level of potential as say the
burger prospect from previous exploration.  Anyways this could all be suggested for inclusion in the final EIS so some
feedback would be appreciated.
 
Thanks,
 
Alex
