Okay, the reason it does not come up and why I even continue to forget about it, is because we have spent most of
the last decade specifically focused on the 193 area in relation to all these comment opportunities.  I have made a
note of it on my list and will provide comments on this.  That would have been a dereliction on my part if that had
slipped past.
 
I will send a couple of books, I also have a related poster of Common Marine Life of Kotzebue Sound, its about 2 feet
by 3.5 feet, but if you have some space I can send one or two of those also.  I did all the illustrations for the book and
the poster.
 
Thanks,
 
Alex

Alex,

Please be sure to also include about Hope Basin in your comments.  The areas that are consider for time/area
closures in the DEIS were based on public comments received during the scoping phase of this project.  At that
time, Hope Basin was never mentioned, which is why it is not included in the DEIS.  However, if you include it in
your comments, we would be happy to consider it in our evaluation as we move forward to the final product.

It would be wonderful if you would be able to send us a couple of copies of the book.  We would be happy to review
the materials in there and reference it as appropriate in the Final EIS.

Thanks,
Candace

Thanks for the quick response.  We are going to support a level 1 with required closures from alternative 4.  
 
Surprisingly there is another area we did not discuss in enough detail and that is regarding the Hope Basin, while
it is included in the EIS area, the discussion (and exclusion/timing areas) mainly focuses on the general area of
193 sales.  However if it is likey that seismic activity will occur in the Hope basin (which is included in the EIS area
afterall) then our comments would be tailored to add exclusion areas in and adjacent to Kotzebue Sound.
 Northern Kotzebue Sound is extremley important to our members for seal and beluga hunting, as such
exploration activity would have great potential to impact this if not done with proper timing and geographical
restrictions.  I forgot to give you a copy of our recent book "Combining IÃ±upiaq and Scientific Knowledge:
Ecology in Northern Kotzebue Sound, Alaska", discussing this area, which by the way should be referenced in
the final EIS bibly - it can be found at:

It would be nice if you could order a copy or two to support the effort, but I would be willing to send either on of

you, or the reviewers in NOAA a copy or two for developing the final EIS if needed, just let me know.
 
I imagine Kivalina and Point Hope would want exclusion areas also.  It is easy to forget or not notice the inclusion
of the Hope Basin including the nearshore areas, sincen again the majority of the discussion is focused up north
and of course that is where all the money is invested and Hope Basin has not proven the same level of potential
as say the burger prospect from previous exploration.  Anyways this could all be suggested for inclusion in the
final EIS so some feedback would be appreciated.
 
Thanks,
 
Alex
